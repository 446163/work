Mobile computing and remote access - mainly remote access

	main idea

- You built your own desktop and therefore you like to use it, even when away from it i.e. In Scotland or at your dad's.
	Stemmed from having a bad laptop and a fast desktop, wanted to use its power and the files and programs on it. Use it as a server

- Really useful to business - can access desktop and functions when away from office rather than carry all data with you I.e. Sales people running demonstrations via a tablet / financial advisers / accessing data and software / architects looking at or changing plans on site.
	you
		access my files and code on my desktop from where ever

		change plans globally so that every one knows
	society
		simpler to access files and emails as they are all in the same place and can be accessed by all devices
		safe as a backup on a more reliable and secure place

- Security - massive security implications to prevent unauthorised access to data / systems.
	Symmetrical v asymetrical encryption - blowfish v RSA 
	Explain RSA and how to set it up on linux maybe...
