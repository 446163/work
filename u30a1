In this section I will be describing the different type of hardware that are used in graphics as well as how these are used when doing graphics. In addition to this I will also be describing the software that it available and how they compare for different tasks. 
The main components in a computer that are used heavily and required for graphic processing are:
	Monitor
	RAM
	Graphics card
	Processor
	Hard drive
The main piece of hardware that is used for graphics editing and creation is a monitor, this is used to view the images and that you are using and as such it necessary to complete any graphical work. The ability to view the images well might seem trivial but the only other real alternatives that exist would be to constantly print out the images in order to see what you are doing or use a terminal that can only user ASCII characters and as such this would not be high resolution. 	
Another main component that is used in the processing and creation of graphics is computer memory, or RAM. This is used generally for the ability to have many things running at the same time or many things running at the same time and that these programs can have enough space to run all of these things (this is not the processing ability here). Within the context of graphics, the use of more RAM will allow the user to edit larger images quicker (as they can all be stored in RAM and not on the hard drive). In addition to this, having more RAM will also allow the user to apply more effect to an image as these can be stored temporally in RAM and this will make it go smoother. 
Another quite important component in computers that is used for graphics creations and editing is a discrete GPU or a graphics card. This is used to unload processing that would normally go to the CPU and it is sent over to the Graphics card where it can be processed off the main system processing and can be processed faster than normal. This can be processed faster on a GPU than a CPU as the GPU is specifically designed to be faster as processing graphics as it has many more processing cores than a CPU but these are lower clocked ad image processing is normally the same calculation applied to the different pixels of the same image. This will help with image editing and creation as it will allow all of the effects that the user will apply to the images to done done faster and as such they will save time when applying these effect. In addition to this the addition of a GPU
In addition to the other components that are in a computer a high-end processor is also used in image creations and modification. With a high end processor in a machine that is used for graphics processing the user will be able to do general tasks on the computer as well as simple tasks quickly. In addition to this high end processors will also have the ability to run more things in parallel as they tend to have a higher number of cores and a higher base clock that is used for processing the images and graphics. Furthermore, with a higher end processor in the machine the user will be able to run the whole program faster.
The final computer component that I will be listing here is the hard drive or really any main storage medium for the computer. The main two examples for this would be a hard drive and an SSD. The main reason for having a large hard drive and the reason that it would be useful for graphics and image editing would be the reason that the user will have the ability to store lots of different images and image files / software. At the moment the size of the average large hard drive would be about 1 to 2 TB and with these you can store many many different types of files. This is also a good idea as it means that you can have a backup of all of the images you make so that you will never lose them in any case and it is also important for what you are uploading images online as you will have to store all of the images on your computer before you can upload them.

When actually creating digital images and graphics there are many different types of software packages that you can use, however in this section I will be only explaining a few of them that are available. The main differences between software that you will be looking for is if the software is one for raster or one for vector editing.
For this comparison of software I will be comparing MS paint and inkscape.
Inkscape software uses vector graphics and Ms paint uses raster options. 
The main difference between these is that inkscape store the equation of the line and the items that are being drawn. This is a positive as it means that the image that is created at the end has the ability to be zoomed in and moved around a lot yet it will still keep its original quality throughout the process. On the other hand the file size when using this type of image can get quite large and the software that it uses is far more complicated in most cases. 
On the other hand the alternate type of image format is raster. This works by storing an array or a grid of all the colour information for each pixel. This is great as it means that the actual image file is quite small and it can very easily be compressed so that it is even smaller and that it is also very easy for downloading the image through a slow connection or where the size of the download is limited. In addition to this, in most places the software that is used for raster images is a lot easier to use and as such it is more friendly to beginners. However, on the other hand the software that mainly uses raster images can be a lot simpler and as such not have the same functionality. 
In addition to these two pieces of software there are also many other graphics editing software available. One example of this would be the type of software that is available for use within a web browser. A main example of this would be a website called PixlR, this is a website that offers the ability to edit images through their online service with access to a large variety of tools that is similar to Photoshop. These types of software can generally be both used for both raster and vector graphics due to the fact that they are offered in the web browser and that they will not have the most advanced features available. Finally, these pieces of software that run online are also generally available for free due to the fact that the software contains a lot of adverts inside of it and that the company will also take the customers information and get money off of that .

In this section I will be comparing the different pieces of hardware and software for use with graphics editing.
To start off with I will be comparing the different hardware that is used to capture images to be used for photo editing. 
When capturing images there are different ways that they can be captured/produced. The 3 main ways that I can think of would be:
	Photography with a camera 
		Film
		SLR
	computer render 
		capture card
		Desktop render
The main and most predominant way that photos can be captured and then edited it a computer is through the use of a camera and then loading this into a computer. For this there are two main that the images them selves can be taken, and this is through either the use of  a(D)SLR camera or a film camera. With these pieces of hardware the user will nee to take a picture
