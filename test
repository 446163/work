Hello Riki,


Glad you got a good result. But yeah, a week business trip is quite a long one, especially if you are actually working for most of that.


I guess that makes sense really if I think about it. I like how you still hide the real meaning in there though, that's cool. :P

Well, it doesn't look like NIME will be in the UK anytime soon so that's a shame. But I will still keep an eye on it.


Yeah, I have had a look at lilly pond and it actually looks really useful, I may use it at some point.

Unfortunately Sibelius is not a free piece of software but it has loads of tools and is actually quite powerful.

Yeah, I used it while I was at secondary school, the music department had macs for composing music and the macs had Sibelius and Cubase software that we could use. Sibelius was great as I could create the composition that I wanted in midi and then put it into the actual score which I had to present at the end. So I basically had to use Sibelius and another great feature of it is that you can compose of the actual staff itself and click to place the notes.

Oh, that's great. It would be really nice to have a group like that, if I try to choose a Touhou song with some people I was with they would not play it as they have no idea what I am talking about and they know some much more popular songs that they would like to play.

Ah, so you got some  of them to like Touhou as well.



I noticed that they had the industrial theme in their music when I listened to a few of their other songs while I was working the other day. I quite like that fact about them and it reminded me of a song that I liked that I used to listen too....but I cant remember it's name.

I can see what you mean by the synth drums in that song, it works really well. I have used synth drums a bit before in FL studio when I am messing around with the DrumSynthLive VST. I quite like the user of drum synth over normal drums a bit because I fell like they add a bit more substance to the song and I like that. I have also listened to a few of YMO's songs and I really like them, it's just good techno music. Also I now have that song stuck in my head as it's quite catchy. The analogue synth is also quite similar to the FL studio mobile app (Creation software rather then PC controlling software), this is also in the desktop software as MiniSynth Live I think....but I'm not sure if that's its name.

Ahh, I see. So do you / your friends go to these concerts normally? And will you be going to this one because Isao will be there?

This is the first time that I have heard of Isoa Tomita and I am a bit surprised as he seems to do some music that I like.  What songs / albums of his do you think I should listen to, what ones are his best?


Yeah, it is really expensive but I guess that all professional music software is anyway so it's not too bad.

I must say that the MOOG modular does look very nice and would be great to have......if I had the money for it.

Yeah, so I have FL Studio producer edition and then after an update I found out that Image Line included sytrus in my version of FL studio so I now have it. That was quite nice as when I originally got the software I didn't have access to sytrus but I really wanted it as I was playing with the demo as it had some nice sounds. If you have producer edition you may want to check if you have it.

I have seen / heard about kontact before, and it was actually the first thing that I was looking at when I was looking for a soundfont player. I was going to get it because of its great reviews and feedback, but then I found a free soundfont player called sforzando, and I have been using that for a while.


Yes, it is a 76 key keyboard and the keys are semi-weighted so they have resistance like actual piano keys, but not the full weight. It also does have a piano as sound source and it uses AWM Stereo Sampling for the sound as it says on the website. It also does have a midi port (One of the most important features) and I have a Yamaha midi cable to connect that to my computer and use it as a synth.

The keyboard is called a Yamaha Piaggerro Np-31 and is supposed to be a small portable piano rather than a synth keyboard:
