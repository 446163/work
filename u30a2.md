## Introduction 

In this assignment I will be going through different technologies and software that are used for editing and manipulating digital images. In addition to this I will also be going through these tools by demonstrating them on a poster that I will be creating to advertise my college and its course. 

## P3 - Demonstrate the use of editing tools to edit and manipulate images

In this section I will be demonstrating tools that are available in most image editing software packages and applying them on random images. 

## P4 - Create original graphic images to meet a defined user need

In this section I will be creating a poster to advertise the UTC reading college as well as the extended diploma in IT course. For this I took the photos myself and them edited them with PixlR to change the brightness levels and so on. 

The first image that you can see is the raw images that I took around the college and as such these have not yet been edited. After this there is the initial revision of the poster with text and other information added to it to actually make it a poster. In addition to this I will also show a few of the changes that I made to the original image to make it more appealing as a poster. 

Below, you can see the raw images that I used for the poster:

And here you can see the end result of the poster after I have added the text and made it into the proper poster: 

## P5 - Modify images as a result of user feedback 

In this section I will be editing the poster that I have created based on feedback that have received on it. The feedback that I will be getting for this will be from my IT teacher who I was doing this unit for. 

## M2 - Justify the software, tools, file format, image resolution and colour depth used for creating graphic images

In this section I will be justifying the use of the software, tools 

## D2 - Discuss the impact that file format, compression techniques, image resolution and colour depth have on file size and image quality
