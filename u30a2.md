## Introduction 

In this assignment I will be going through different technologies and software that are used for editing and manipulating digital images. In addition to this I will also be going through these tools by demonstrating them on a poster that I will be creating to advertise my college and its course. 

## P3 - Demonstrate the use of editing tools to edit and manipulate images

In this section I will be demonstrating tools that are available in most image editing software packages and applying them on random images. For this i will be showing the demonstrations using PixlR as it is a free online tool for things like this. In terms of the tools I will be showing how to:

* Create a new file
* Open the menu
* Open an existing image
* Close a file
* Superimpose one image into another one
* Copy
* Paste
* Blending
* Clone tool

### Creating a new file

## P4 - Create original graphic images to meet a defined user need

In this section I will be creating a poster to advertise the UTC reading college as well as the extended diploma in IT course. For this I took the photos myself and them edited them with PixlR to change the brightness levels and so on. 

The first image that you can see is the raw images that I took around the college and as such these have not yet been edited. After this there is the initial revision of the poster with text and other information added to it to actually make it a poster. In addition to this I will also show a few of the changes that I made to the original image to make it more appealing as a poster. 

Below, you can see the raw images that I used for the poster:

And here you can see the end result of the poster after I have added the text and made it into the proper poster: 

## P5 - Modify images as a result of user feedback 

In this section I will be editing the poster that I have created based on feedback that have received on it. The feedback that I will be getting for this will be from my IT teacher who I was doing this unit for. 

## M2 - Justify the software, tools, file format, image resolution and colour depth used for creating graphic images 

In this section I will be justifying the use of the software, tools, file format, image resolution and colour depth that I used for editing the images that I have shown in this document so far. I will be writing about a few certain things for each of these sections as well as explain generally what each of the items that I talk about are. In addition to this I will also be describing in a more general sense the ways that the following things are used rather than just what I have specifically used for this assignment. I will be laying out section out like this:

* Software
	* PixlR
* tools
	* Copy and paste
	* Crop
	* Brighten
	* Hue Changing
	* etc....**ADD MORE HERE**
* File format
	* .jpg
	* .png
* image resolution
	* **INSERT ACTUAL IMAGE RESOLUTIONS HERE**
* Colour depth
	* **INSERT ACTUAL COLOUR DEPTH HERE**

### Software
	
In terms of software that I have have used the main one would have to be PixlR the online image editor that I used to actually apply all of the changes to the images that you have seen throughout the whole of the document. 

PixlR is an online image editor that is made to be as full fledged as is  possible within a web browser whilst staying as a free tool that anyone can use to edit images how they want to. The best way to think about it would be to compare it to Adobe Photoshop as it has a very similar set of tool as well as the ability to do layers that most other software does not allow for. The way that this website / service generates money is through the use of advertisements that cover a partial amount of the right side of the screen and through the use of accounts that can allow for online storage as well other advances features that generally have no real consequence apart from of you are using the software in a company atmosphere.  

The main reason that I have used PixlR for all of the images within this document and not another peace of software is for quite a few reasons. The first is that PixlR is a free peace of software and for me as a user there is no coasts at all involved. This is fantastic as there is no other peace of software that I have found that allows for all of these features that PixlR offers whilst still being free and having the ability to run on all computers (like in a web browser for example). Although there are advertisements that could be thought of as a cost I did expect them in any peace of software because it is free. 

In addition to this I also chose to use PixlR because it offers all of the tools that I would need whilst working on these images throughout this document. I say this is important as a lot of software out there that I could have used would have lacked in quite a few tools that I would have used. Due to this it would be a bit more difficult to actually accomplish the desired effects and images that I would have wanted and it would have made the work take a lot longer. The main tool that I am talking about in this is the layer tool as it is very good to have different layers whilst editing images and not a lot of software actually has this tool. 

### Tools

In this section I will be going through the tool that I used for editing the images seen above as well as explaining how these tools work in general and why they are useful. The tools that I have used for these images can be seen in the list above and these are what I will be explaining. 

#### Copy and paste

The most basic function that should be included within all software would have to be the ability to copy and paste certain selections of images or text and then have them appear within other parts of the image of other parts of another image without having to redo everything over again for the new image.  

The reason that I have chosen to use this tool is due to the fact that it has allowed me to copy over certain areas of an image and then move them over to  a different section of the image without having to stretch the image or do any other complicated methods. This should be pretty self explanatory because the ability to copy and paste available I almost every peace of software so most people would have used it.  

#### Crop

Another main tools that I have used throughout the images within this document is the crop tool. This tool will allow the user to crop the image that they have to the size that they want the image to be. This can be very useful to cut off any parts of the image that are not needed or would ruin the image overall. This works by zooming in on an image and then setting the border of the image to be what the current zoom is like. However, this can also be done in a general sense rather than just zooming in and having a rectangle cropped area as you can select a general area to have  cropped so the image could crop around a certain object. 

The reason that I have used this tool for the images that I have used throughout this document is because it is very useful to cut out certain parts of the image that are not needed and as such it can bring the general quality of the image up. 

#### Brighten

Another tool used when editing images is the ability to brighten the images that you are working on. This is a very helpful tool as it means that you have the ability to brighten up photographs that may not have been taken in optimal situations. Therefore it allows you to adjust the image after it has been taken to make it look more appealing. 

The reason that I have used this for a few of the images that I have taken, is due to the fact that when I took the image the light conditions were not perfect and as such the image did not come out as I had intended. For example in a few of the images the subject of the image came out a bit dark due to the camera metering on another item in the frame and as such the white balance of the image is off making the whole image dark er than it should have been. However, which the ability to brighten the image the whole image can be brought up in brightness making the image look like how I intended it to look. 

#### Hue Changing

A tool that is not often used but is used occasionally and in a n image in this document is the hue tool. This tool will change the balance of colours throughout the whole of the selection within an image, this will have the effect of applying a filter of a certain colour over the image and this can be used to make the image look a better colour than it otherwise would be. 

The reason that I used this for the images that I have used is due to the fact that that some of the images that I took had the colour looking a bit strange due to the weather and the colour of the other object in the frame. Even though the colours were looking a bit off I could then use the hue changer to make the images look a lot more natural and so the images would be more appealing. 

### File format

When actually using the images that I have use throughout this document there have been a few different file types that I have used. The file type is the way that the information for the image is actually stored in 1's and 0'S on the computers hard drive and there are many different standard to organise and govern how these are arranged to store the data. The main two file formats that I have used .jpg and .png.

## D2 - Discuss the impact that file format, compression techniques, image resolution and colour depth have on file size and image quality 

In this section I ill be going through the different file formats, compression techniques, image resolutions and colour bit depth as well as what they are and how they actually end up effecting the overall image quality and file size. For this I will be explaining this in the following order:

* File format
* Compression techniques
* Image resolution 
* colour depth

In addition to just explaining the impacts I will also be adding in images and screenshots demonstrating and showing the visual differences as well as providing evidence to my claims. 

### File format

When actually doing image editing and such the file format that you choose to use can effect greatly how good and what the size is of the image file. This section will be very similar to the last section of the precious section as that also want through the different things to do with file formats. As mentioned, the file format is the way that the image is actually stored on the disk and how the 1's and 0's need to be arranged to actually save the image file so that it can be read. 

There are many different file format especially for images but the main ones are .jpg and .png. These are very commonly used as they provide a sufficient amount of image detail and fidelity whilst also having a small image file size so it is ideal when you are on the internet as it will download the images fast while they also look good. One thing to note is that both of these file types are bitmap files so they will have pixelisation and will have a loss in quality when the image is zoomed in. These files work by storing the images as an array of pixels and the colour that they will have as well as how the pixels themselves are arranged in the image and the overall resolution / size of the image. 

An alternative to this is the use of vector images, these work by storing the information about the image as a set of equations that models how the lines in the image are as well as how the area in between the lines is filled with colour. This will make it so that the image in question will have the ability to be zoomed in without ever losing quality as when you zoom in the equations will just adjust to the zoom level that you are using and it will use plug the number in to the equation in order to get the image to a higher quality. However,due to this the size of the file that is used for the image can be quite high, especially with complex designs. However, with more simple designs with a few colours and shapes then the file size can be very small as it will not need to store much information. However, these tend to not be used too much and as such there is a lack of file types and support because they require a bit of processing power and that is it much easier to use bitmap graphics so they have not been too prevalent. 

So overall, the way that the file is stored will effect how large the image file actually is as well as how nice the image will look in the end.
