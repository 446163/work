# Unit 7 
# Assignment 1 - Know your threats 

## Introduction

In this assignment I will be writing up about different security threats that are out there and the impact that these can have on an organisation. For this specific assignment I will be writing about the way that aerospace companies can be affected by these security threats and what they can do to the organisation. In addition to this I will also be writing about how the companies can help reduce the risk of these security threats from happening and how they reduce the chance they they do. 

## P1 - Explain the impact of different types of threat on an organisation
### Example 1
### P1
For my first example I will be writing about the threat of people private information being stolen from the airport network by hackers. This information could be the credit card information that people flying on the plane used to purchase their flight with and if this information was compromised then the hackers would be able to spend money on all of their cards and get away with quite a lot before they are caught. In addition to this, the airports reputation would also be reduced and less people would use their services in the future resulting in to company possibly going bankrupt.  The main reasons that this would be able to happen come down to weak system security in terms of access, logins and encryption.
### M1
With this particular issue the impact of the threat is quite high but only to the customers and not to the actual company itself, just indirectly. As mentioned, the main ways that this could happen would be the weakness of the current logins and encryptions. In order for the hackers to gain access to this information, they will first have to gain access to the whole system network that holds this information and this would most likely have to be done remotely. This is where the first security issue will come into play and this is the ability to remote access the system and the security involved within this, this is because the system should not have a very weak connection authentication and should be protected with a very secure password, or even better, and RSA key is length longer than 2048 for optimal security. With this in place the hackers would have to effectively guess a password that is 2040 characters long. In addition to this the airport should also make sure that they us encryption on the database to ensure that if the data is stolen then the actual details can not be reached and it will take quite a while for the hackers to decrypt the data to a readable format. This will then give the organisation time to recover the data or retrieve it from the hackers so that they cannot do anything with it. One example of this was a hacker called Albert Gonzalez who used his hacking ability to steal over 170 million credit cards worth of information that he would then sell on. He did this using SQL injection which utilises the weak security that some online web pages had and with this he could gain access to the database where the customer information as stored. As a result of this he was caught and placed in jail for 20 years that start in 2010. 

### Example 2
### P1
Another example of a security threat that may happen within a aerospace organisation would be the effect of bad staff and how they could abuse the system for their own sake.
