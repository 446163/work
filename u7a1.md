# Unit 7 
# Assignment 1 - Know your threats 

## Introduction

In this assignment I will be writing up about different security threats that are out there and the impact that these can have on an organisation. For this specific assignment I will be writing about the way that aerospace companies can be affected by these security threats and what they can do to the organisation. In addition to this I will also be writing about how the companies can help reduce the risk of these security threats from happening and how they reduce the chance they they do. 

## P1 - Explain the impact of different types of threat on an organisation
### Example 1 - External Threat
### P1
For my first example I will be writing about the threat of people private information being stolen from the airport network by hackers. This information could be the credit card information that people flying on the plane used to purchase their flight with and if this information was compromised then the hackers would be able to spend money on all of their cards and get away with quite a lot before they are caught. In addition to this, the airports reputation would also be reduced and less people would use their services in the future resulting in to company possibly going bankrupt.  The main reasons that this would be able to happen come down to weak system security in terms of access, logins and encryption.
### M1
With this particular issue the impact of the threat is quite high but only to the customers and not to the actual company itself, just indirectly. As mentioned, the main ways that this could happen would be the weakness of the current logins and encryptions. In order for the hackers to gain access to this information, they will first have to gain access to the whole system network that holds this information and this would most likely have to be done remotely. This is where the first security issue will come into play and this is the ability to remote access the system and the security involved within this, this is because the system should not have a very weak connection authentication and should be protected with a very secure password, or even better, and RSA key is length longer than 2048 for optimal security. With this in place the hackers would have to effectively guess a password that is 2040 characters long. In addition to this the airport should also make sure that they us encryption on the database to ensure that if the data is stolen then the actual details can not be reached and it will take quite a while for the hackers to decrypt the data to a readable format. This will then give the organisation time to recover the data or retrieve it from the hackers so that they cannot do anything with it. One example of this was a hacker called Albert Gonzalez who used his hacking ability to steal over 170 million credit cards worth of information that he would then sell on. He did this using SQL injection which utilises the weak security that some online web pages had and with this he could gain access to the database where the customer information as stored. As a result of this he was caught and placed in jail for 20 years that start in 2010. 
### Example 2 - Internal threat
### P1
Another example of a security threat that may happen within a aerospace organisation would be the effect of bad staff and how they could abuse the system for their own sake. For example, in the airport the staff could abuse the powers that they have over the system to give places to their friends at a cheaper price as they could just add them to the system easily and get the profits from them to make money. If this happens then this could be quite bad as the airplane company could lose money as they are not get ting full pay from all of their customers on the plane and this could eventually mean that the company could go bust or be forced to lay off employees. In addition to this the staff could also change some things about the system that are set in a very specific way and this could lead to a total system failure and could damage the reputation of the company for a while. The main way that this could be stopped would be to have different levels of user access for all the different staff in the company. This would limit the users to only have access to the system to the parts that are can use and are authorised to use.
### M1
This threat of staff being dishonest with the system and using it for their own sake would have quite an impact on the IT system and its ability to work correctly. For example, if all the staff had full access to the system then anyone could change it (even accidentally) in such a way that it will not work correctly and this could mean that the system could make mistakes when making bookings or it may break the system completely in such a way that it cannot be fixed easily and this could cause huge problems for the company and lose them a lot of money. In addition to this, the system might contain certain personal customer details that all the staff could have access to, this would therefore mean that the data could be in the hands of the wrong person quite easily. As well as the impact this would have on the IT system this type of internal threat would also have an effect on the organisational issues within the company. One example of an organisational issues within the company would be that with the requirement to have an IT team available to all of the staff within the company due to the way that they will all have different passwords and levels of user access within the system. This will be needed due to the fact that there will inevitably be issues with the system and these will need to be sorted. This will require there to be some additional infrastructure installed in the company like an additional phone line possibly or an additional office somewhere so that there can be help. This is an organisational issue as it affects the management of the whole company and it will also affect the security of the IT system as people could access file they are not supposed to without the different levels of user access being in place. So, this problem can be fixed by making sure that all different users have a secure password and different levels of access to files and folders in the system. 

### Example 3 - Physical Threats
### P1
For this example I will be writing about how physical threats can affect the aerospace industry and what consequences this could have. The main example of this would be the hijacking of the airplanes whilst they are in flight. For this treat to actually happen there are quite a number of things that need to go right so it is quite rare for it happen but if it does then it will be a very serious incident to happen. Another way that there could be a physical threat would be if people broke into the place where the servers were stored then they could steal certain information from the hard drives in the server and from this they could get private information. This is a physical threat as the information is physically being taken from the servers rather than being taken through software. This type of physical attack
