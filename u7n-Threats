Nimda virus

nimda virus was a worm that infected files and allowed the access of a computer from external sources. it was released in 2001 on the 18th of September and it spread to be the biggest known computer infection of all time in just 22 minutes. The creator / s of the virus are unknown, however, in the source code for the virus it clearly states "Concept Virus(CV) V.5, Copyright(C)2001 R.P.China" so from this it is clear that it is from china. 

Nimda was so successful due to the way that it spread and how it operated once it was inside the computer. 
Nimda used 5 different methods to infect the machines that all used different exploits, these methods were:

Email attachments
network shares
websites
exploits in microsoft iss
backdoors that were left behind from previous virus attacks. 

The purpose of nimda is not known well but it is predicted that it was supposed to slowdown network traffic all over the world due to the way that it was designed to spread and the fact that it didn't seem to change a lot of files on the host computer.
