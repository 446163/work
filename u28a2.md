## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the creation of a website along with how certain parts of it will work together with the user and why these decision's have been made. I will go through the initial design with sketches, the resulting website, the tools used, improvements that can be made and show that the website meets the users requirements. 

## M2 Explain the tools and techniques used in the creation of an interactive website  

In this section i will go on to explain how certain parts of a website can be used to make it interactive and how these will all work behind the scenes to make it interactive. The main way that is used to make a website interactive would be to add in the ability for the user to select things on the site and this would then change what is on the page but by not loading another page. One way that this can be done is through the use of radio buttons on the website, these are the circle buttons that you see on websites that allow you to only select one of them rather than multiple, with this the user can then select on of many things to display on the page, but in practice more advanced methods are used due to the fact that radio buttons don't look the best. So, for example if you had a website where you could be a watch then you could use radio buttons to select what colour you want the watch to be and then the appropriate image would load and then when you place your order the correct one will be selected. Behind the scenes, he buttons will work with two different programming languages, html and php in most cases. html is the mark-up language and so this will be how the buttons are placed on the screen and aligned and so on. Then the buttons will interact with the php code behind the scene to actually perform functions like loading the image and so on. The way that this works is that the group of radio buttons are assigned a name and then whenever the value of the radio buttons is changed the value of the name changes as well and this then means that the webpage can then be told to load a different image based on the value of the name and the fact that it has changed. This will work in a similar way to the sending information about the purchase as the webpage will just need to send of the name of the colour of the watch that the user wants and then this will go to the warehouse and the correct colour watch will be sent out to the customer. 

Another way that a website can be interactive is trough the use of textboxes and forms for the users to fill out with this the user can then fill out a large amount of information that they want the website to have and then the website will get all of it and do what it wants. The main ways that this is used is through the use of forums and websites with comments, the way that these then work is that the user will fill the textbox with the information that they want and then send that information of to the website, in most cases this will then past that information along with information about the user who posted it and some other information. The way that this works behind the scenes is similar to the previous example in that the textbox uses both html and php (in most cases). The textbox is placed on the page with formatting with the html and then the information that it contains is process with the php. From here the text is probably scanned for words / phrases that the website would not like to be posted on the website and then it is then processed into html so that it is formatted on the website properly and is not just unformatted text. This could mean placing headers and titles to be underlined or highlighting certain words and so on.   

## D2 Discuss the techniques that can be used on web pages to aid user access to information  

In this section I will be going through how a website can be designed to aid the users access to information so that the user of the will be able to access the content that they want to both quickly and easily. The main ways that this can be done is through the use of navigation aids throughout the webpage that will help the user get to what they want with the minimal number of clicks needed. A few examples of these navigation aids would be sitemaps, search bars, anchors and sub-menus. For this section I will be explaining all of these features and how they will actually aid the user along with how they work. 

### Sitemaps

One of the main aids that are used for people trying to find a specific thing over multiple websites would be to use a site map. This is a list of where you can find certain things on all of the websites that are a part of the main website. This will only really work where there is main website and there are multiple websites that are a part of it bus still separate. For example, the Cashew website is designed so that it has one main page and then all of the sub brands have their own website, as an example the Csio website has its main site casio.com and then has a separate website for the edifice collection of watches at http://edifice-watches.co.uk. A sitemap will work well with this company as they will have many different subsections and products that are hidden away under many different subsections, in addition to this with more than one website  you will be able to map it out easily. The way that a sitemap works is that it will
