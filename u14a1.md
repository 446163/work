## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through and explaining how event driven programming works as well as how it can be used in practice and how it can then be implemented. 

## P1 - Explain the key features of event driven programs
 
For this section I will explain what event driven programming is as well as a few of the features that it has and finally some examples of how they work. 

### Definition

The main feature that defines the use of event driven programming is the idea that the all the functionality of the program will come from the interaction that the user has with the software and nothing will really be happening when the uses does not tell it to. This will mean that the software will react to the users input rather then processing information that it has like most other programming languages. You may say that almost all programming is like this due to the fact that it will have to react to the input that the user gives it as otherwise the software will be hardcoded and will only be able to produce the same output over and over again. But, this type of programming is used when you want to interface with something and you need to see when the user would have clicked a button or when they added something to a list rather than seeing what they provided as an argument to a program.

From Wikipedia, the definition of event driven programming is as follows:

> In computer programming, event-driven programming is a programming paradigm
> in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions
> (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads. 

As you can see, this covers the same points that I have said but with covers a bit more information. This will there for mean that the programming for this will end up being a lot of user interface as well as GUI applications. 

### Features

Due to the fact that event driven programming it used for GUI and human interaction the features that it has at the heart of the process are well defined and fit for purpose. For example their are many ways that event driven programming languages will be able to detect and know that a human interaction has gone on. What I mean by this is that there are many different inputs that the user of the program can put in can be detected. This ranges from the simple like a mouse click of cursor location all the way up to the complex of unique sensors that can detect pressure and so on. In order for the detection of sensors and so on to work there needs to a small running process in the background that actually detects when the value of the sensors has changed so that the program can carry on to work and actually process the information that it needs to do. This small process that runs in the background is called the event loop because it is the loop that runs over and over again to detect the events that the program will run off of. 

### Examples

There are many different examples of how and where event driven programming can be used but for this I will only cover a few. The main example that comes to mind is the programming that is a part of forms that you would fill out in order to search in a database. This would use event driven programming due to the fact that the program will not search through the database until the user has clicked the button to that tell the program that the information that needs to be searched for has all been input. The program will use the features of event driven programming like mouse clicks and so on to know when the user has done with the data input. This is why most of the Microsoft office suite comer with the ability to make forms and macros' and so on with the programming language of visual basic as it is an event driven programming language. Another place that event driven programming is used is in GUI applications in general,  this is because with all GUI applications they well need to wait for either the user or anther process to access them so that they can display the information that they need to on the screen. Although event driven programming languages well often have ways that they can run the background process, they are not really designed for this and so they will not be as efficient or as fast as the process could be done. 

## P2 - demonstrate the use of event driven tools and techniques

In this section I will be going through some examples of how event driven programming is used and how the techniques that I mentioned before are actually used in practice and how they could be programmed. For this I will be exalting the use of the following features:

* tool boxes and controls
* selection
* loops
* event handlers
* triggers, objects and object properties
* menus
* debugging tools 

### Tool boxes and controls

When using visual basic there will be a toolbox off to the side that you can use to select different controls from that are all used as a form of control within the program that you are making and all of there are the human inputs that I mentioned in the previous section. From this control box all of the following items that I will talk about can be accessed and added into the program. You can gain access to the tools by clicking on the toolbox tab and then clicking and then you will see the following menu appear:

From here you can then click on the common contrlos sub-menu and you will see a list of the most commonly used tools that I will partly go through in this section:

### Selection

When you want to select something in the form that you are creating the process is very simple as you just have to click on the item that you want to select and then it will be selected for you. From here you can then choose to delete the item or change it in any way that you want to. However, the term selection may also mean the process of selecting information that you want to process or a certain part of the program to run depending on the state of the program. The main way that this is is done in most programming languages is through the use of 'if' statements. With if statements the program can bract off and perform different tasks depending on the value of a poise of memory. An example of a typical 'if' statement would look like the following:

``` 
int a = 1
if ( a == 1 ) {
	/* run this code if a is equal to 1 */
}else{
	/* run this code if a is not equal to 1 */
}
```

As you can see, in this very small program there well be different paces of code executed depending on the value of a. To start off with, in the program the variable 'a' is created and it it told that it is a number that has a value of 1. On the next line the value of a is tested to see if it is the equal to the value of 1. If the value of a is equal to 1 then the program will run the code where it states this on the next line. Then there is the else statement, this means the opposite of the if and this will run if the value of a is not 1. The next line is then the code that will run if the value of a is not 1. Finally the if statement is closed off. From this you can see that a program can very easily make a selecting from information that it has and this can lead to the program taking or rather selecting what it needs to run. 

### Loops

Another main section that all programming languages use is loops, as you could guess from the name, loops are used to run a section of code over and over again and they have the ability to change the state of a variable depending on how many times the loop has run. Due to the fact that loops are needed there are 2 main types of loops that are used in most programming languages and these are 'for' and 'while' loops. The way that they both work is very similar but generally the for loop is used when you need to recur a process a set number of times while a while loop is used when you want to recur something an unknown number of times when you are creating the loop. Below there will be an example of each so that you can see how they are laid out, first there is a while loop:

```
sensor a = /dev/pressure1
while ( a > 10 ) {
	/* run this code */
	a = /dev/pressure1
}
```

From this you can see that at the start the value of the variable a is set to the value of the pressure sensor that the computer is plugged into. Then the loop starts and as you can see, the program will run the loop over and over again while the value of a is grades than 10, as soon as the value of 'a' changes and it is not greater that 10 then the loop will stop and the program will skip past it. One thing to note is that for a while loop you need to have the value that you are testing, be changed in the while loop. This is needed because without this the loop would never end and the code could run in the loop forever and the program would not work. Due to this the code in the loop will re-read the value of the sensor and so there will be an opportunity where the loop will stop and so this is a valid while loop. As you can see, for this loop you would not know how many different times you would need to run the loop and so the while low would be the one that you would use. 

In addition to the while loop there is also the 'for' loop and this is used when you know how many times you need to run the loop, so here is an example:

```
for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
	*/ this code will run 100 times */
}
```

In this example the loop will run the code inside it 100 times and then stop. The formatting for this loop is a bit strange but it is easy to explain and so I will go through that now. The first part of the loop is the 'for (', this is just used to start the loop and tell the compiler that there will be a loop here. The next part of 'i = 0;' tells the compiler that there will be a new variable called 'i' that will hold the value of the loop and will change value each time the loop repeats. The next part of 'i < 100;' tells the compiler that the loop will keep on going while the value of i is less that 100 in this case. It is similar to a while loop in this respect but it is just all in one. The final part of the loop is 'i++ )', this tells the loop how to change the value of i with each pass of the loop so that it can count the value correctly. In this case the value of i will increase by 1 each pass of the loop as 'i++' is the same as 'i = i + 1' in most programming languages. Finally the ')' closes the logic part of the loop and the '{' opens the code of the loop. As you can see, in this example the value of i starts at 1 and increases by 1 until it gets to 100, so the loop will run 100 times. 

As you can see loops help you control a program by ensuring that you don't have to write out parts of the program over and over again. In addition to this you can also use the value of the loop variable in the loop so that you can run the parts of the loop over with a different value each time.

### Event Handlers

When you are programming in an event driven programming language event handlers will be needed in most cases. An event handler is a small section of code or 'routine' that is used to handle and process actions that the user would input to the program that need to be caught in a separate line of processing to the main code. This will cover things like mouse movements and keystrokes (key presses). The reason that these cannot be run in the main thread is that the process will have to wait for the user to potentially press a key and if the program is waiting for this then it cannot carry on with the rest of the stuff that it has to do and so the program would not work. For example say that your program would have the option to press 'w' and move forward when you do so. Then you might think that you could code like so:

```
...
if ( keyboard.press == 'w' ) {
	moveForward(Player)
}
...
```

Now This would technically work as when the code got to this place and the player pressed 'w' then the player would move forward in the game, but there are 2 main problems with this and that is that the way the program detects the button and the time at which the player presses the button. The first problem is that the game will get to the part of the code that is shown above and then it will wait for the keyboard to be pressed and then check if that key that was pressed was the 'w' key and if it was then the program will move the player forward and if not then it will skip past. But what will happen if the player is not pressing any key on the keyboard? In this case the game will freeze at this place as it is waiting for a key to be pressed to see if it is 'w'. If you have the main code also processing the movement of enemies for example then they would not move when the keyboard is not being pressed and as such the game will not have the effect that is needed. The second example is that the program will only detect the keystroke when it is at this past in the code and if your main loop of the program takes a few seconds to go through then you will have problems. Lets say that the program has just checked the keystroke for 'w' and is now running the code just after it, lets say that you want to quickly move forward then you would quickly tap the 'w' for a split second. Due to the fact that the program is not processing the code that relates to you pressing the key at that moment then the game will not know that you wanted to move and that is a problem. If you did not use event handlers then you would have to do the event that you want to do at exactly the same time that the code checks to see if you are doing that event and this will mean that it will not work properly. In addition to this, you will also have the program stop and wait if you are not doing the type of action that it wants to detect. This is why event handlers are used. 

Instead of having the code for the detecting of events in the main section of the code it would make sense to have it in a very small and fast section of code that would run on a different CPU core as well. Well, that it the definition of an event handles and with it you can have the detection for the program work well. The way that the event handler will run in this separate state is in what is called a callback routine. And in this way, the input will not cause any of the problems that I have listed here and will actually mean that the main loop will have better performance because it will not handle the input at all. 

### Triggers

When you are programming in event driven programming, a trigger is a certain thing that is set up so that when the conditions that it has been set are met it will perform an action. In a way it is very similar to an 'if' statement that is always being checked for while the program is running. This can be included in the previously mentioned event handler, but may be done in a separate one to the one that is dedicated to the controls.
