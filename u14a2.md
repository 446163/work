## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the production and the design of small, event driven program along with how it will work and how I apply the techniques that I use. 

## P3 - Design and event driven application to meet defined requirements

For this section I will be going through the ideas of the program all the way through to the pseudo code that the program will run. 

To start off with, the idea of the program is that it will be an application for music playback that you would only need to use the keyboard for. The way that this would work is that if you wanted to change the music that you are listening to then you would alt-tab to the program and you would then be able to press certain keys that you have configured to play/pause, skip...etc... the music that is playing on your system, in addition to this the program would also accept input from when it is not running and focused by using the function keys in addition to the normal keys that you have set.
