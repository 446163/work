## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the production and the design of small, event driven program along with how it will work and how I apply the techniques that I use. 

## P3 - Design and event driven application to meet defined requirements

For this section I will be going through the ideas of the program all the way through to the pseudo code that the program will run. 

### introduction and purpose

To start off with, the idea of the program is that it will be an application for music playback that you would only need to use the keyboard for. The way that this would work is that if you wanted to change the music that you are listening to then you would alt-tab to the program and you would then be able to press certain keys that you have configured to play/pause, skip...etc... the music that is playing on your system, in addition to this the program would also accept input from when it is not running and focused by using the function keys in addition to the normal keys that you have set, this will mean that you can control the program all the time no matter where you are on the system.  

### Show tools and techniques used

In this sub section I will be going through the tools that I used for this program as well as how I used them. This list will therefore contain information on the following things:
selection, loops, event handlers, triggers, menus, variables and their scopes. 

#### selection

When programming there is a need to have selection so that the program can selection between things and decide what so the best thing that it needs to do with the given inputs. This will mainly show up in the form of if statements and there will be a lot in this program. One example of this would be in the main loop once the program detects that the program is playing music. What will happen in that the play function is actually a toggle that will play the music if paused and pause the music if it is playing. An example of some code would be as follows:

```c
if ( musicStatus == 'Playing' ) {
	musicControl(Pause);
	musicPlaying = 0;
} else {
	musicControl(Play);
	musicPlaying = 1;
}
```

As you can see, in this example there is a selection in the form of an if statement that will play the music if it is not playing and will pause the music if it is playing. This is now a toggle for the music playing.  

#### loops

In similar way to selection, loops are a main way to control the flow and logic of a program that will repeat a section of code while a certain condition is true or for a certain number of times. In my code there will be a lot of loops but one of the main loops will be the main loop that is used for the program to run and I call this the main loop. The function of this loop is to ensure that the program will carry on running when in the background and the whole program will be inside of it, it will look like this:

```c
while ( mainLoop == 1 ) {
	...
}
```

With this loop in place the program will carry on to run until the variable mail loop is set to 0 and this will be done by pressing the x button in the top corner of the program. 

#### Event handlers

Event handlers are a main and nectary function for all OOP programs as this is the part of the code that will take the key inputs from the keyboard and send them to the program. This is special however, as it is in its own small function so that the inputs re detected as quickly as they can be and the program logic does not get in the way of the inputs. An example of this would be: 

```c
char EventHandler () 
{
	while ( 1 == 1 ) {
		c = getchar();
		keyInput(c);
	}
}
```

As you can see in this section of code, it in its own function and will keep getting characters from the keyboard and send then to the keyInput function that will then intemperate them into the actual main function. 

#### triggers

Triggers are section in the code that act like and if statement but will do an action when a certain vague criteria is met, the can be thought of as a type of if function. One example of this would be in the keyInput function that was mentioned in the previous section. What could happen, is that when the key input into the program is <space> then the program would play or pause the music, this would therefore be the trigger to toggle the music and it could look like this:

```c
	...
	} else if ( c == ' ' ) {
		if ( musicStatus == 'Playing' ) {
			musicControl(Pause);
			musicPlaying = 0;
		} else {
			musicControl(Play);
			musicPlaying = 1;
		}
	}
	...

```

#### Objects and object properties

When you are programming in an OOP language then you will need to have objects and all of those will need to have properties that will determine ho they function and what they can do. In this program there are not many objects due to the fact that it is a very simple program, but some of the objects will be the buttons that are on the front of the music player program. These will be objects as they will all have a similar function and can be interacted with at any time during the program run time. Also, these will have to have properties that will dictate how they behave and these can be inherited from other templates in the program, here is an example of what it could look like: 

```c
object playButton ( int status )
{
	inherit button;
	if ( status == "0" ) {
		display.image(Paused.jup);
	} else {
		display.image(Playing.jup);
	}
}
```

#### menus

When programming you will be using an IDE in most cases that will have menus with helpful menus and tools, but I am not using such an IDE and so there are no menus to show .

#### debugging tools

Again, similar to the last section, normally you would use these to help with the programming section, but I have not used this.  

#### Variables

In this section I will show some of the variables that I have used in this program along with what scopes are, what constants are and what data types are. 

##### declaring variables

When you are programming there is a need to manage spaces in RAM that you can give names to control the value that they contain and read fro them later on. But in order to do this you will need to have told the program what memory you want set aside and then what that will be called by, this is done by declaring the variable. Here are a few examples:

```c
int status = 0;
const char musicStaus = 'Paused';
```

In this example you can see that there have been two variables declared and set up, the first few words indicate the data type which is basically the size in memory that should be set aside for the data that it is gong to be store. Next there is the name and in this example the names are "status" and "musicStatus", these are used to refer back to the space in memory so that it can be read and written to. Finally at the end there is the value that the variable will be set to initially and in this example that is the number 0 and the string of "Paused".  

##### scope of variables

When you are programming there will be different scopes that variable can be created in and as such they can only be accessed in the certain scopes they they are created in. For example, if you were to create a variable in a certain function, then that variable would only be able to be accessed in that function. This therefore has the side effect that you can have variables that have the same name in the program but because they are in different scopes then they are not the same variable and point to different information. One example of this could be a variable called "i" that would only be used when you are counting the loops of a for loop, this can then be used in many different loops all over the program so that you know that "i" just counts that loop. Here is an example of this:

```c
	...
	int i;
	for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
		...
	}
	...
```

##### Constants

Variables are just a section in memory that has a name and that you can read to and write from in a way constants are basically just the same its just that they can only be read from, not written to. It means that they have a constant value and never change. There are many ways to do this in may different programming languages, but one example is below:

```c
#define MAX_HEIGHT 127
```

In this example the text MAX_HEIGHT now represents the number 127, and that cannot be changed during the running of the program. This is great as it means that you can set a global max height for something and easily change it when you need to when creating the program and then all section of the code will follow that global rule. 

#### Data types

As mentioned before, there are many different data types that variables can take and the reason that they exist is so that the program can allocate the memory that it needs the most effectively so that not too much memory is taken and so that not too little memory is taken. In addition to this the data types also help keep the formatting of the data that you store correct so that it will be of a valid format. Below is a small summary of the some of the man data types that exist:

### Show examples of triggers used 

In this section I will go through some examples of the triggers that I have used in this program. As mentioned, triggers are parts in a program that are used to active something once a certain criteria has been met. These are mainly used for user input rather than just internal logic and thats how they are mainly differentiated between. In my program there are a few different triggers that are used and these are when the user presses a button and when they click on the buttons on the screen. The button down will detect when the user presses a button on their keyboard and that will then be sent through to the program and the screen click will register when the user clicks the icons on the program. Here is some example of the code:

```c
...
	if ( play.buttonClicked == 1 ) {
		if ( musicStatus == 'Playing' ) {
			musicControl(Pause);
			musicPlaying = 0;
		} else {
			musicControl(Play);
			musicPlaying = 1;
		}
	}
...

...
	if ( play.keyPress == 1 ) {
		if ( musicStatus == 'Playing' ) {
			musicControl(Pause);
			musicPlaying = 0;
		} else {
			musicControl(Play);
			musicPlaying = 1;
		}
	}
...
```

### Indicate all properties to be assigned to screen components

In this section I will briefly go through the properties that will be assigned to the screen components. In my program there will be a very simple user interface which will be a screen with a few buttons
