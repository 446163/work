Understand why software needs installing or upgrading 

there are many reasons that software will need to be installed or upgraded. For example, within a system you might need software installed on a users computer to allow them to complete a job they could otherwise not do or to complete a job, in a better and more efficient way that they otherwise could have. 

why does UTC reading need to upgrade and instal software on the machines
think about internal and external prompts
problems, functionality, new installations
external user, bug fix, company policy

Within UTC reading there are quite a few different reasons that software will need to be installed or updated on the machines and below i will lost some of these in reference to internal and external prompts on the system. 
the main reason that software might be needed to get installed is a problem with the main system that doesn't allow things to happen that should be able to happen. For example, if the computer requires a driver to be installed in order to use the touchpad on the laptops then this software will need to be installed as otherwise people will have trouble using the machines and can't get work done. 

Another reason that software might be installed is the ability complete tasks or other processes that could not be completed otherwise. For example, if the user in engineering requires the ability to create and renew models in 3D to3D print, then they will require custom software to be downloaded
