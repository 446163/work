Understand why software needs installing or upgrading 

there are many reasons that software will need to be installed or upgraded. For example, within a system you might need software installed on a users computer to allow them to complete a job they could otherwise not do or to complete a job, in a better and more efficient way that they otherwise could have. 

why does UTC reading need to upgrade and instal software on the machines
think about internal and external prompts
problems, functionality, new installations
external user, bug fix, company policy

Within UTC reading there are quite a few different reasons that software will need to be installed or updated on the machines and below i will lost some of these in reference to internal and external prompts on the system. 
the main reason that software might be needed to get installed is a problem with the main system that doesn't allow things to happen that should be able to happen. For example, if the computer requires a driver to be installed in order to use the touchpad on the laptops then this software will need to be installed as otherwise people will have trouble using the machines and can't get work done. 

Another reason that software might be installed is the ability complete tasks or other processes that could not be completed otherwise. For example, if the user in engineering requires the ability to create and renew models in 3D to3D print, then they will require custom software to be downloaded 

4 advantages of installing software (2 install, 2 upgrade)
4 dis-advantages of installing software (2 install, 2 upgrade)

P1
	in what kind of hardware and software problems enforce UTC Reading to

	upgrade software and hardware. You need to consider:

	* Internal prompts

	o System users

	o Problems with the existing system

	o Requirements for additional functionality

	o Installation of new hardware or software requiring new or

	upgraded software

	* External prompts

	o External users

	o Software bug fixes and system prompts

	* Other, such as company policy 
P2
In your class or as a group, broadly discuss what risks can occur during installations and upgrades. You need to consider: * Potential loss of service * Incompatibility issues * Risk reduction measures o Backups o Choosing appropriate low-risk time for installation o Rollbacks o Incremental installations Make notes of yours and other students ideas and write a report to encapsulate the discussion 
	

D2
From looking at the potential risks of installing and upgrading, you now need to explain how these risks could be minimised and evaluate their potential impact; gauging how to minimise the effect of the risk. * Potential loss of service * Incompatibility issues * Backups * Choosing appropriate low-risk time for installation * Incremental installations 

M1
You must explain the advantages and disadvantages of installing and upgrading software. You need to write about 4 advantages (2 installations and 2 upgrades) and 4 disadvantages (2 installations and 2 upgrades): Advantages could include: * Functionality * User interface * Speed/efficiency * And many more Disadvantages could include: * Cost * Training/Lack of familiarity * Change * Reliability issues and many more
