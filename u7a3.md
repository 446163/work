## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the different IT guidelines and policies that are around and govern the use of them as well as legislations and laws surrounding this area. 

## P4 - Create an illustrated report detailing the policies and guidelines that are used to manage IT security issues

In this section I will be going through different policies and guidelines that are in effect when you are managing IT security threats, for this I will be going through how these will effect my organisation of choice (Airlines) as well as some examples that would be found in colleges such as UTC Reading. 

In this whole section I will be writing about the following:

* Software acquisition
* Internet and Email usage
* Data protection act and Copyright laws. 

### Software acquisition 

With any system that is holding private data there is an obvious need for the system to be secure so that the information is not released and so that people know their data will only be used how it is needed. Due to this fact the system will be needed to stay secure at all times so that no information can get out. This then requires all of the software on a system to be checked to ensure that it is using the data how it is supposed to and that there are no vulnerabilities that could leak the data. This will then require that all of the software on the system has been checked and is allowed to be there, this would all be managed by the IT people to ensure that all of the people using the system have access to all of the software that they would need whilst also ensuring that the system stays secure. And this is where the fist policy for secure system used in airlines would come into play: You are only allowed to install approved software on the system. 

With this in place the people using the airline system would not be allowed to install their own software onto it that could leak information like customer's bank details and so on. However these is the need for a certain balance with this although it would nor really effect the user too much especially on a very secure system. This is the balance between the software available for use and the security on the system, this needs to be right as on one side people would not be able to do what they want / need to do on the system while on the other hand information could be at risk. Although, on very secure systems this would be expected by all users so there might not be any problems with the lack of software as they can still (even at a very basic level) do what they need to do with the software on the system.  

For example, at UTC reading the students / staff do not have the correct level of access to install programs or applications on to the college's computers as when you try to install something it asks you for an administrator password that only the IT people know. This therefore means that the system stays secure as the users of the system cannot install their own programs but IT also allows for the administrator of the system to install application on an individual basis as they know the password. However, this is never done on practise as it would be a hassle to keep a track of and other people would also request to have the software as well. Instead the IT administrator use a system where the software is installed in the background on the machine over the college network. This will therefore mean that only a certain version of the software that the IT administrators have deemed safe would be installed on the computer and that the computer would still be able to be used throughout the installation process.  

### Internet and Email usage

Another main and important IT policy that is practised basically everywhere is the practice and policies that surround the use of internet and emails that are sued for work. In general this policy covers that fact that the users of the system (Internet and email systems) should only be allowed to use them for work reasons not personal and that all content that could be deemed not appropriate for work in any respect should not be done on these systems at work. For the first section of this part I will be writing about internet and in the second part I will be writing about emails. 

#### Internet usage

When at work the internet that users are granted access to should not be used for person issues / uses and should only be used for work / work related items. This will therefore allow for two different advantages for the users of the system even if they do not like it. The first is that the restriction on the internet would mean that users would be less likely to be distracted due to the fact that certain websites that they use will be blocked. This will mean that the users will be less distracted while they are at work and as such they will be more productive throughout the day. In addition to this the fact that the policy will block certain websites will also mean that the security if the organisation will stay in tact and the suers will not be able to get to content online that could pose a security threat. This is again quite similar to the installation of software limitations as it means that the users of the system will not be able to put the system at risk by having illegitimate content. 

For example, with this is place the users of the system would not be able to access sites such as Facebook or Reddit and so they will not be distracted and they will actually get on with more work throughout the day. Furthermore the fact that websites that will allow access to illegitimate programs are blocked means that the users of the system would not be able to download programs and such from Softonic and other download sites. This would then means the  in order to get software that could steal data and put the system a risk the users would have to use an external medium and that is more difficult to do accidentally. This would also be very detestation in a situation where the system is question is an airline one because there need to be secure because they hold very private information about customers that in addition to this the system that is in place will also have certain access to actually flight data and could alter the people on a flight and so on.... Furthermore the system will have be part of an intranet that the airline company uses to store and use their data in, if software that is run on a web browser managed to send information about the system through to other people then the intranet would be know and could then be abused by people or hacked. 

![Internet usage image](http://consensushr.com/mpc/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/internet-usage-policy-ireland.jpg)

At UTC reading we have a similar policy in place as the internet that all of the people here can access is filtered so that people cannot access items that they are not allowed to while in work. Although the policy and regulations that we have here at UTC Reading are a bit more strict that would be at other places the main reasoning and policy remains. With the filter in place all the users of the internet here know that the internet that they have access to is being monitored so they cannot access all of the things that they could do while they are at home. For example we cannot access sites that would distract us like steam as we could then play games through college time rather than doing actual work. Furthermore download sites are also blocked like Softonic as with this users could download software that would not be good for the system that we have in place here. 

#### Email Usage

In most organisations the people who work there will get a work email address that is hosted by their work places and allows for them to communicate with all of the people who they might be working with. Due to the fact that the people will get this email account for free from their place of work the email generally has a policy surrounding it about how it can and cannot be used. In most cases this policy will restrict the usage of the email to be only for work related content much like the internet access as this will also be monitored by the company that you are working for to ensure that this is the case. However, in addition to this the company may also have further additional rules about how users use their work email account. One main one that often in place even non-officially is the fact that the users cannot use their work emails to harass or be mean to people and that they should only be used for good and work related content. Furthermore the company may also have a policy about how the users may need to delete all non-essential emails that they receive and empty the recycling bin of their account frequently. The reason that this last one may be necessary as because the organisation any have a limited storage space to actually store the emails that go through their work email accounts, due to this they request that the users clear as much space as they can on their accounts to accommodate other information that will have to be stored.  

For example when talking about an airline company then there will definitely be a system set in place for users of the system having their own work email address as the organisation would have to be quite large anyway so an email system would be no problem. In addition to this the airline company would also ensure that the content going through the emails would be appropriate for work because the nature of working with an airline company has security in mind and so the use of emails for non work purposes would not be allowed. In addition to this an airline company would also not allow the users of the email system to send harassing or mean messages through the email system. This would be due to the fact that at an airport it is supposed to be a friendly pace and also the harassing that people may be doing could be against the law and the company would obviously want to stop this. The final point here is not really a problem for an airline company due to the fact that they would have a lot of server space but it could come in to effect in some cases. This could be the case as some airlines may not have a large amount of free server space with their systems and databases already stored. As such this may come into effect and the emails service might automatically delete emails after a set amount of time. 

For example, at UTC Reading there is a system set up where all of the people at UTC will get a UTC college email address that they can use, however this is limited to only work / college related stuff as they are checked and go through a system. This is also the same for ensuring that the emails are not harassing people and so on.

### Data protection act 1990

 A final main IT policy that I will be writing about here is the data protection act of 1990 and how that will effect how the system is used with guidelines and policies. To start off with I will go through the data protect act an what it actually means. Below you will see a very brief summary of the data protection act from 
 
https://www.gov.UK/data-protection/the-data-protection-act:
 
> The Data Protection Act controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government.
> 
> Everyone responsible for using data has to follow strict rules called ‘data protection principles’. They must make sure the information is:
> 
> * used fairly and lawfully
> * used for limited, specifically stated purposes
> * used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive
> * accurate
> * kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary
> * handled according to people’s data protection rights
> * kept safe and secure
> * not transferred outside the European Economic Area without adequate protection
>  
>  There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information, such as:
>  
> * ethnic background
> * political opinions
> * religious beliefs
> * health
> * sexual health
> * criminal records

![Date protection act image](http://magikos.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DPA-1998.png)

The points described about should be very simple and obvious within themselves about what they mean but below I will briefly go through what they mean and what impacts they actually have upon these people storing the information. 

To start off with, in general the data protection act is in place to protect the data that is stored about people by companies. This is done so that it will minimise the information that is stored so that in event of a disaster then not too much information will be released. However, it is also in place so that companies actually have enough information about their customers to be useful to them. 
The first point about be lawful and using the information fairly basically means that the information that the company collects about you should not be used for criminal purposes. The second point means that the information should only be used for what the user has agreed their information to be used for and nothing else unless the user agrees to that new part again. The third point here is similar to the previous point as it means that the data should only be used for what the user has agreed the data to be used for. The fourth point here means that the information must be kept accurate and up to date, this is so that the information is not incorrect as this could be quite bad for the user in the long run. One of the main points here is that the data must no be kept for for longer than it is needed, this is important as it means that once a customer no longer uses the companies product then they are not allowed to store the customers information. The next port basically means that the information must to handled in respect to the laws that I am reciting. The next one here says that the information must be kept safe and secure so that the information cannot be cases by people who should not have access to the information. The penultimate point here is that the information must not be transferred outside of the European Economic area, this is due to the way that the data protection act was created and how it is enforced but companies can transfer data between themselves with the users permission. The final point here is that certain information that's considered very private to people is under more strict legal protection as it is more private. 

So this must be followed when any organisation is storing information and MUST be kept to as it is a legal obligation. So this would be needed for an airline especially due to the type of customer information that they store so it should be a policy and guideline that is followed. 

## P5 - Creation of an illustrated report concentrating on how employment contracts can support or obstruct an organisation

In this Section I will be going through the advantages and disadvantages of employment contracts as well as what they actually are and how they effect people. 

To start off with I will be explaining what an employment contract actually is. For this I will be using the gov.uk website as this holds the actual definitions for the laws and provides a great summary. This was taken from the web page: https://www.gov.uk/employment-contracts-and-conditions/overview 

> All employees have an employment contract with their employer. A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee’s:
> 
>* employment conditions
>* rights
>* responsibilities
>* duties
> 
> These are called the ‘terms’ of the contract.
> 
> Employees and employers must stick to a contract until it ends (eg by an employer or employee giving notice or an employee being dismissed) or until the terms are changed (usually by agreement between the employee and employer).
> 
> If a person has an agreement to do some work for someone (like paint their house), this isn’t an employment contract but a ‘contract to provide services’.
> Accepting a contract
> 
> As soon as someone accepts a job offer they have a contract with their employer. An employment contract doesn’t have to be written down.

![Employment contracts image](http://www.saracenssolicitors.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Contracts-of-Employment-Solicitors1.jpg)

From this quotation above you can see that an employment contract is basically an agreement between the employer and the employee that dictates how well they are to be treated at the job and what they actually need to completed their job. This will therefore need to kept to as closely as a law because if this is broken then the employer could be violating one of the things listed above and if those are violated then that is the violation of a law and the employer could be prosecuted. 

As you can see this is a very good thing to have be done but there can also be certain drawbacks to this and in the next section I will be going through the advantages and the potential disadvantages of employment contracts.

### Advantages

When talking about employment contracts there are many advantages that they can have that will be beneficial to both the employer and the employee. The main advantage that this would bring to both sides of this would be that the initial terms and requirements of the contract are visible to both of the parties involved so there is complete transparency. This would therefore mean that both people would be able to spot any unfair conditions that would not be viable for the actual workplace and these can then be fixed before the employee starts working so that both sides get exactly what they want from the job. For example with this contract the employee could see that the work place would not be giving them adequate rights and that the conditions that they would have to work in would be in violation if human rights from this the employee would then know not to work for that company and save themselves. On the other hand the employer would then also be able to layout exactly what duties and responsibilities the employee would have and this could then be used as a contract in the future so that the employer would know what each of the employees should be doing whilst at work and if they are not doing that then they may be fired as they are no doing their job.  

In addition to this, another advantage of an employment contract is that it can be used as a legally binding contract for what the employer would have to provide for the employee so that they can actually work and do their job effectively. This would therefore mean that the employer would be able to do costs and accounting easier as they would know in advance what they will have to get for the employee and that there will be no more major additional costs. Furthermore this will also allow the employee to know what it is that they will have access to when they are doing the job and so they will be able to prepare for wheat they will be working with. This will be beneficial to both sides and allow them both to prepare for the new job. 

A final advantage of employment contracts is that the employer would be able to put in confidentiality clauses that would prohibit any employee from sharing or giving away trade secrets that only a certain company knows. With this in place the employer knows that the secrets will stay safe and this would allow the company to stay successful and not lose information. Without this in place the employee would be under no obligation to not share the information that is a trade secret to a certain company and this would then mean that they could give out the information if they wanted to and this could then give advantages in a certain industry away from s  specific company. 

This would come onto effect for an airline company a lot as it would mean that employees would know exactly what they are needed to do and when you are working as a part in IT this will be very helpful as it could be very easy for someone to give you a job related to what you do, but if you are not supposed to do that job then you could do it wrong. This could have many downsides and cause the security and integrity of the system to be at risk and this could then cause a massive It failure. Additionally, it will also allow the employer of an airline company to know exactly what each person should be doing and this could then mean that they will be able to know who is not doing the job that they are being paid for. Without this the employee could be getting away with not doing critical work on the IT system and without this it could go down and cause some downtime for the company. Finally it would also mean that the people who work for the IT sector are legally not allow
e to reveal the inner workings of the server and critical information like to anyone else and this could keep the system secure from attacks. 

### Disadvantages

However as with anything there are also some disadvantages to the system and these can have some adverse effects that were not intended to happen. The main disadvantage that happens to employment contracts is that they are designed to last over a certain amount of time (say, 2 years or so) and the problem arises where the conditions of the employment have changed since its creation and as such the employment contract will need to be changed or the employee would need to be negotiated with. A main example of this would be if you hired an employee and in the contract it was written that you would have them for 2 years, but after only a year the employer found out that that particular employee is not needed anymore. At this stage there are two options that could go ahead, firstly, the employee and the employer could renegotiate the terms of the contract in such a way that they both feel happy with the result of, alternately the contract may have to be terminated, but in this case the employee would be able to take legal action against the employer as they have broken the contract that was in place and in this case the employee would most likely win the case and the employer would have to pay them to compensate. 

An additional disadvantage to the employment contract is that because it is a legally binding contract then if the wording is slightly ambiguous then one of the sides would be able to exploit that fact and this could lead to bad things happening as they could technically be correct with exactly what they said but it is not what was intended in the contract. This could then lead to complicated court cases as people try to work out what was written in the contract and what exactly what it was supposed to mean.  

A final disadvantage is that the employment contract will limit the flexibility that the company has over the employee as if they want the employee to do something additional to what they are already set out to do in the contract then they will have to re-negotiate the whole contract in order to fit around the new role / job that this person will need to do. This can then lead to the company losing money over wasted time through this process and then this could lead to losses to the company that the would not have otherwise. 

For example at an airline company, This could be bad as the boss of people working for the IT section in an airline system could realise that some of the people that they have hired are not needed any more. This could have happened as there might have been a server migration project that would have required only a few IT engineers but if they accidentally got another person just to be sure or due to an error then they might have to got rid of them as they are not needed and the company would be wasting money. In another example the company could also then make a certain employee do some wok that they did not know that they were going to do because it would technically be covered in the employment contract but the employee did not know this / know that they would be required to do this. This could therefore lead to battles between the employer and the employee that could lead to could cases. This is also bad in the airline sector and people are generally very busy with their work and so adding more work for the person  to do could be a LOT for for them to do and they might not be able to cope. 

### Conclusion

So as you can see, there are many good yet also many bad things about employment contracts that can lead to both great and negative situations. Despite the downsides that I have listed employment contract are still an essential part of how modern businesses work and as such without them everyone would be a lot worse off so it is a good idea to actually have them in place rather than not. 


## P6 - creation of an illustrated report detailing legislation in the areas of privacy laws and security policies regarding data. 

In this section I will be going through the different legislations that are in effect regarding the privacy laws and security policies that are in effect around data and information. For this I will be going through both of the examples above with an explanation of what it means as well as at least one example of each and how that actually effects the storage of data and the overall effect on people who work with it and how it will actually come into practice for these people. 

### Privacy laws

Here i will be going through the privacy laws that are in place around the use and storage of information as well as how it all works in practise. To start off with what is the actual definition of a privacy law, according to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law):

> Privacy law refers to the laws that deal with the regulation of personal information about individuals, which can be collected by governments and other public as well as private organizations and its storage and use.

This basically means that there are certain restrictions that are set in place for how information about people is stored and handled. Due to the way that this is handled, there can be many different laws that will actually come into effect here as the general idea is vague and that and law relating to the actual protection of information that could be to do with someone personal information or anything that would be considered private will cover this. Although this is the case for this section I will only be going through the Human rights act of 1998 and the data protection act of 1998. I chose these ones to explain as these are the most well known among people and they have points that are very related to the point and so are not too vague. Furthermore, as I have already been through the laws in previous sections of this assignment I will not be stating the while law in it entirety but I will be stating the part of the law that is relevant to the privacy of people as per this section. 

To start off with the first law that will cover this section is the Human Acts Right of 1998. This is a main one that counts as it has an entire article about privacy and it is as follows:

> **Article 8 - Right to a private and family life**
>
> Everyone has the right to respect for his of her private and family life, home and correspondence. This right is subject to proportionate and lawful restrictions.

Although this is by no means a complete guide and description of the article, it does provide a basic understanding about it and how it works.

*For additional information about this section you can read about it here:
 https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act/article-8-right-private-and-family-life*

Basically it means that as a basic human right people should be allowed to have their own private life.....private and that it is to be respected along with ANY information about it. Although there are of course some exceptions like when national security is involved, but that is a different thing. This would then ensure that companies that keep information about people are not able to e keep information about people that could be seen as being part of their private life as this would be violating a human right as they are not respecting that. Due to this, in practise for an airline company that could very easily be avoided by just not requesting that sort of information from your customers. This would therefore mean they the airline company would not have access to the data and so they cannot do bad in this respect. So as you can see although there is this law in place, when talking about an airline organisation there should be no worries at all and no changes to the standard procedure because the company will not even be storing the information that this concerns. 

However, for the next law it will not have the same outcome, this is because this law is the Data Protection Act of 1998. 

> Data Protection Act controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government.
> 
> Everyone responsible for using data has to follow strict rules called ‘data protection principles’. They must make sure the information is:
> (http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article3039522.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Hacker.jpg)
> * used fairly and lawfully
> * used for limited, specifically stated purposes
> * used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive
> * accurate
> * kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary
> * handled according to people’s data protection rights
> * kept safe and secure
> * not transferred outside the European Economic Area without adequate protection
> 
> There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information, such as:
> 
> * ethnic background
> * political opinions
> * religious beliefs
> * health
> * sexual health
> * criminal records

*Further informationabout this act can be seen here: https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act*

As you can see, this law will very much so come into effect, especially for and airline company. In basic terms it means that the organisation ins only allowed to store data and information that it needs and actually uses, all other data is irrelevant and as such it should not be stored. Due to this, this would actually have quite an effect on the company and how they manage the data that they hold. The main things is that the company will have to ensure that the information they have is correct and that it is all up to date with the customers. In addition to this the airline company must be very careful about how it collects its data as if they collect information that they don't need of their service then it can look suspicious. In practical terms this would man that all of the information that the airline company gets will have to be stored securely and that all the information is kept accurate as mentioned. This can have quite a cost on the airline company as they would have to ensure that the information and data is thoroughly secured and that will be quite expensive but this has already been mentioned in assignment 2 of this unit so I won't go into too much detail. 

One final note here is that the information should also any be allowed access by the people who need to use the data to keep the integrity of the private nature of some information. In practice this would mean that all of the information would have to be handled carefully and kept relevant to what is needed to be stored as well as being only available to certain people. And this leads nicely onto the next topic.....security laws

### Security laws

In addition to the privacy that have been stated already there are also certain security laws that need to be followed by any organisation that is storing information. To start off with, security laws are laws that are set in place to ensure that information is stored in a secure way and that it is only accessed by people or programs that need the information in order to ensure that it is not leaked. 

Although there are many different laws that cover this section as it can be seen as quite vague the main ones that I will be going through here are the computer misuse act of 1990 and the data protect act of 1998. I have chosen these laws to go through as they are well known and their example can be explained the simplest. 

The first law here is the computer misuse act of 1990 and the way that this covers the security and access that people will have to information. The computer misuse act is as follows:

> **Computer Misuse Act 1990**
>
> The Computer Misuse Act was introduced partly in reaction to a specific legal case (R v Gold and Schifreen) and was intended to deter criminals from using a computer to assist in the commission of a criminal offence or from impairing or hindering access to data stored in a computer. The Act contains three criminal offences for computer misuse:
> * Unauthorised access to computer material;
> * Unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences;
> * Unauthorised modification of computer material.

![Computer misuse act image](http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article3039522.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Hacker.jpg)

*Further information about the actual act can be found here: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents*

The computer misuse act basically dictates that it is illegal to access or use a computer system that you do not have permission to access, in addition to this it also extends to ensuring that any content may not be modified on the computer system. Due to this any company that wishes to stay within the law must also provide adequate protection against people committing there crimes and that is where this comes into context within they assignment. This will therefore effect how an airline company would store and manage their data as they have to ensure that it is actually safe. There are of course man ways tat this could happen and so I will only explain a few. To start off with due to the fact that airlines store vert confidential information about customers they should ensure that the information is encrypted so that if it is taken then it cannot be accessed. When actually used in practice this would not have much effect at all as the computer dealing with the information could very quickly and easily decrypt the information so no time would be lost there. Furthermore the airline company should also ensure that only certain people have access to the information both digitally and physically. To protect against average staff working in the airport accessing confidential customer information there should be a certain level of access that each staff member gets that allows them to get by with their job nut no more as this could lead to problems. This would then  mean that only the server administrators and the programs that need to access the information can actually get it as they are the only ones who need access to it. Furthermore that addition of Limiting people physically from the data would mean that staff should have access cards that limit them form certain areas of the airport so that only the server administers have physical access to the machine. This would mean that the average person or staff member would not be able to modify the data or access the system and this would uphold the law. 

In addition to the computer misuse act another law that would come into effect here would be the data protect act. For this I will not describe it because you can look up to the previous section as that explains it the same that I would have done here. The data protection act come up here as well as it has sections on the security of the data as follows: 

> Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.

This basically means that the information should be protected by an appropriate level of security in order to ensure that it is not leaked or stolen so that it is only used where it is needed. This can be seen as very similar to the previous statement as it goes on the same basis that in practice this would lead to a greater level of security that the airline company would need to have for their data. Another way that an airline company could keep their information secure so that they are not in violation of the data protection act is by ensuring that there are multiple layers of security between someone being able to access the system. This could start off with being a simple login with the correct username and password. For this to work the password would have to be of a suitable strength with complicated characters and numbers as well as being above certain length. In addition to this there could also be security cards that would need to be scanned in to the system to ensure that the person logging in is who they say they are. This would therefore mean that anyone trying to get into the system would have to the physical card from the actual person themselves and this would be far more difficult. A final example of this would be two factor authentication as this would allow mean that the system would send a code to the person phone who is trying to log in. This would mean that anyone truing to get into the system would have to also have access toe the person phone. With all of theses taken into consideration this would make an airline system far more secure without addition too much hassle for the users of the system. This is because if the data protect act is broken then the airline could be made to pay up to 100,000 pounds.

## M3 - Creation of an illustrated report detailing ethical issues in IT security. 

In this section I will be going through two different ethical issues that are involved when it comes to IT security. I will then also be going through how other issues could be involved with this main issue. Furthermore I will be explaining how this could come to a conclusion by what sort of decision can be agreed upon by both sides as well as how this can be related to an airline organisation as they could come to face some of these issues. Finally I will also be explaining how students would deal with the situations and how they would solve it as an example.  The two ethical issues that I will be going through are **freedom of information vs personal privacy** and **premissions for access of content**. 

### Freedom of information vs personal privacy
#### The issue

To start off with I will explain the basic premises that this ethical issues is about and hen I will go on to explain more in depth. The basic way that this is an ethical issue us down to how people should have their personal information checked and their activity monitored vs companies and organisations being sure that people are staying legal and do not pose them a threat. For this there are multiple examples that I could cover but I will go through major one and that is terrorist plots. 

#### The issues involved

The issues here come in two different sides, those who want complete transparency with all people to know exactly what they are doing and if they are at any time breaking the law / going to commit a crime vs the people who want a right to privacy with their information and what they are doing as it is a human right. This is a major matter that is still being decided to what extent this should be up to today. The main reason that this is an issue is that organisations and the polices want to have access to everyone personal and private information. For companies this would mean that they would be able to exploit people to make more money off of them as they could know exactly what it is that they want and with this they could massively increase their sales and revenue. In addition to this the police also want to have access to all of the internet history of everyone as with this they can actually know before a terrorist attack happens and stop it, saving peoples lives, because they know that some people would be having a meetup and that they are looking to perform an act of terrorism they can stop it before they even do it. On the other hand there are the people who want the basic human right of a right to privacy and that it is far to intrusive for other people to be knowing literally everything about them. Indeed they have a point as this is a basic human right so there needs to be a certain level of privacy but the problem is getting to an equal point where both sides are happy and there is an equilibrium between public safety and personal privacy.   

In terms of IT this will have a massive effect on how companies store customers information and how much of the customers information they are actually allowed to store. On one hand the companies would have to have enough store and a great enough server setup so that they can actually store all of the information about their customers as they would want to maximise the profit that they can get from their customers. But this would mean that they would have to up the security that they have on their servers as this would then contain a LOT if information about all of their customers and if the information was to be compromised then they would be à a lot of trouble but even more so their customers would be as they would have all the information about them leaked and that just cannot afford to happen. On the other hand the companies would have to ensure that all of the information that they about people would not be breaking any laws and that they are staying legal, this would mean that they would have to check all of the information that they to ensure that they do not have to much and that if so then they delete it. In addition to this there would also be strict laws that limit how long they can keep the information about customers so they would have to run a program constantly that monitors that. Either way from both extremes, once a decision has been properly reached all companies and businesses would have to make changes to their system that is a mixture of the ones just mentioned. 

![Ethics image](http://psychologist-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Psychological-Research.jpg)

#### The decision that was come to

At the moment the decision that this has come to is fairly lenient upon the personally privacy side, but it is close to the middle. However, there are big changes incoming that could tip this balance and make changes that not all people are happy about. But first, the current state. 

At the moment the current way that this is is that it is more lenient to the personal privacy side. This is mainly due to the data protect act and a few lines in there, these being as follows:

> * used for limited, specifically stated purposes
> * used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive
> * kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary

From these you can see that the information that is able to be stored by companies is very limited so they they only use the information for what they have stated that they will use the information for as well as only having the amount of information that they need to provide a customer their service. Furthermore the company must also remove all the information that they have about someone when the no longer require their service as if they didn't then they would be storing the information for longer than is necessary. As you can see this means that at the moment the system is set up to be very sensitive to personal information. In addition to this there are also severe penalties that are attached to the breaking of these laws and so that does happen, this then means that companies will try to stay in line with this in order to not get the fine.  

This is also the same with the capturing and storage of internet search history, although this is changing in the UK very soon. At the moment the way that this works is that the ISP stores minimal information about your search history and is only allowed to keep then for a limited time that is quite short, after that time they must delete it. Furthermore if anyone wants to access the information about a certain person search history then it can only be by the police and only if they have a warrant to do so and that means that they have reason to believe that you are a threat to other people. This is also handled in accordance to the data protection act just mentioned. The way that this is changing is that very soon in the future it is a ruling that all of the ISPs (Internet service providers) that operate in the UK must store as much information as they can about everything that goes through their internet connection. In addition to this all the information must be stores for over a year, finally this also requires no warrant to go through the information so the police and other companies can look at anyone's online activities no matter what.  

#### Students thoughts on a solution 

When talking to students and other people about this issues the main consensus that was reaches was very similar to what the current state of play is with this matter. By this I mean that most people agreed that information should only be allowed to be used for it's original purpose and that only the amount of information that is needed to provide the service effectively should be used. However, once mentioned about how this would have an impact on public safety a few people did express concern but came to the same level that it currently stands in where there should only be access granted to the inflation with a warrant available by the police. 

#### How this relates to an airline company

Although at first it may not seem like it, this ethical issue does have quite a large impact on airline companies. The main way that this would have an impact on airline companies is down to how they process and deal with information to do with security. This is because as an airline they will need to ensure that all of the people who are using their service and are going on their planes are doing so without the intension of committing a terrorist act like hijacking a plane. Because this is a very prevalent problem that all airline companies will face and as such any of them would want to reduce the risk of this happening by any means possible, as such they would want to be able to see and use all the information about their customers as possible so that they can ensure that they are safe. This therefore the same problem as the initial one as it is a matter of public safety (On the planes this time) and personal privacy. However, in addition to this the airline company would also like to have as much information about their customers for business purposes as well as they are also a business that needs to make money. In addition to this all of the previous points can be taken into consideration for this specific issues as well to incorporate it with an airline company.  

### Permissions for access of content
#### The issue

The final ethical issue that I will be talking about is the ethical issues that surround the permissions for access of content. This basically covers the issues that are in effect when someone is in or has made content and how that can be used. In some cases this can be seen as very similar to the previous statement as  it can also be to do with how personal privacy compares against safety. 

#### The issues involved

One example of this would be at a company having access to monitor employees activity whilst they are using the work computer systems. For example if you are an IT admin then you would be obliged to ensure that the users of the system are using the system for work only and that they are not misusing the system to do what they want. For example if as an admin you are legally obliged to monitor and ensure that people re using the system correctly, would it be ethical to look into a users personal USB memory stick that they connected to a work computer just to transfer some files? As you can see this will put up the ruling and potentially the security of the company against the personal privacy that people have. This is also very involved with IT as this is where the issue will be primarily faced although it can still apply to other situations in real life. Talking about real life, one example could be that you discover a personal message that the owner of the company has stored on their computer or in an email to a friend. If this message contained information about how the company was corrupt would you share this information or tell anyone else / try to take action? Would this differ if the message was a co-worker and how they planned to undermine the company? Although you are obliged to do this..... Is it ethical?

#### The decision that was come to

With this decision the overall answer is very difficult to come to as if you are going on what the company says that the admin should do then you would have to say that yes, the admin should always look into all the information that even goes close to the computer system no matter of it is personal or private information. And indeed there is a very strong case here, not just because that is what the admin has to do, but also because of the person does not want their information to be read then they should not be using it in a secure work computer system as it will be read. However, on the other hand the person might not realise that they are using this information on the system. This could happen of for example the user has a memory stick that they uses for everything and so they have some files that they were using while at home if they also put work on there like many people would do then when they go into work and grab the files off the memory stick then can the admin scan and read the files off the memory stick. As you can see this also provides a strong counterpoint to the argument. In the end however, this really comes down to the individual IT admin but in most cases there would tend to lean more to the respecting people's private content side if they know that they are not using it. 

#### Students thoughts on a solution 

When asking students what they thought about this issue most came to the conclusion that the system should be monitored for content that is actually being used / loaded onto the system and that if the user is just storing some files or plugging in a memory stick with files that can cause no harm then their content should be respected and not read. However, there were also a few people who would vote for the side of reading all information that goes near the system as that is what the rules of the company dictates and if the user brings in private information on to the work system then they should know that it will be read. 

#### How this relates to an airline company

As with the previous example, due to the fact that this example can be made general for any IT system then you can see that this can easily be adapted for  any situation like an airline company. However, this will also bring in a special case for the airline company in terms of security. This is because the airline systems are generally not connected to the information or or very very secure, this would mean that if any program on the system could cause threat so the system then it will need to be scanned to ensure that it cannot compromise the system. This would therefore lead to the company ensuring that all content is to be scanned and assessed on the system so that the system stays secure. If the airline system was to be compromise then it would case chaos for the company and could put them out of service for a while, making them lose potentially millions in the process, due to these risks, in an airline company rules are taken before personal privacy in most situations.  

## D2 - Creation of an illustrated report evaluating security policies. 

In this final section I will be looking at a few different IT security policies that could could be used by an airline organisation and how these are used in practise. In addition to this I will also be going through how these policies could be changed, improved and what effects this will have of they are changed and if they are not changed. For this list I will be using a document from the Oklahoma government as this will have all of the correct and up to date information for all of the IT security and it can be easily transferred to any IT system in terms of security as it is a very general case.  

*If you wish to read thsi document you can view it here: https://www.ok.gov/cio/documents/InfoSecPPG.pdf*

The policies that I will be going through are information security in terms of password strength, information access procedures and information confidentiality. 

### Information Security
#### How it is used

When talking about information security there are many different ways that it can be used, from storage methods to access methods and transmission methods, but in this section I will be going though the access methods and specifically the policies that are in place for password protection. Although this will differ a lot from organisation to organisation the basic ideas and processes can be transferred to any similar situation. For this example I have the password policy for the Oklahoma Government in the USA and their policy is as follows:  

> System limitations may prevent all of the following procedures to be implemented, however, when possible, these rules apply:
> * (A) Passwords will be required to be a minimum of 8 characters long, containing at least one (1) numeric character.
> * (B) Passwords will expire in a maximum of 90 days.
> * (C) Passwords will be deactivated if not used for a period of 60 days.
> * (D) Passwords for a given user should not be reused in a 12 month period.

![Password security image](http://media.techregar.com/images/2015/03/password-security-006.jpg)

As you can see this is a list of the limitations that are in place for how the users of the system can choose and update their passwords. This would apply to all of the government machines that the users would access and these are in place to ensure that they stay secure. The first item in the list dictates how strong the actual password is, this reduces the chance that the password would be able to be guessed. The password expiration will mean that even if a password is compromised then the system will be safe very shortly after. The next one effectively disable access to the system for user who is not active on the system, this will mean that old accounts cannot be hacked into. Finally the last point means that even if one password is hacked it will be pointless for at least a year and then that's only of the user uses the same password.  

#### Where it could be changed and improved

As with any policy there are always areas where it could be changed either for better or for worse, but there area a few changes that I would like to make to ensure tat it is as safe as it can be. To start off with the main change that I would make is adding on stricter rules for how the actual password is to be created. Although this setup here is strong (and strong enough for the Oklahoma government mind you) I still fell like it could be improved. The way that I would improve this is by ensuring that the passwords would be up to 10 digits long as 8 digits seems to b the standard and I would want more security than that, in addition to this I also think that the password should have at least 2 digits in. I say this as with inly 1 digit most people would have that digit at the beginning or the end and that would make it more easily guessable and crackable for hackers. The second change that I would make to this policy would be to bring the password expiration date down to 60 days so that it is in line with the password deactivation limit. I would make this change as this would ensure that security of the system is upheld as the password would change more frequently, but I don not think that the change would be too much on the users of the system as it is still infrequent when you think about it, only every 2 months will the password expire. It will also be easier to keep track of when the passwords expire and when the password are deactivated as they an be rolled into on process.  

#### The consequences of changing the policy 

In this section I will be going through the consequences that could happen if the changes that I have proposed actually happen. To start off with, Th main consequence would be that the security of the system would be in a better state than if this was not put in to action. This is by far the beat thing that could happen to the system as it would mean that the system would be even more secure than it already is. In addition to this the changes that have made will consolidate the deactivation and the expiration of all of the passwords on the system to the same date, this will be easier to manage as well as having a slightly tighter security as the password will expire and deactivate meaning that it is completely useless to any one who would want to access the system with a slightly old password. However, on the other hand due to the fact that the expiration dates for the passwords are now a little bit sooner this could cause a problem for the users of the system as they would have to keep changing their passwords and this could get annoying especially since they cannot use the same password that they have used within the past year, and this will cause people to get agitated, but overall I think that it would be a good idea to implement these changes.   

#### Consequences of not changing the policy

On the other hand if the policy is not changed then there could be bad consequences that could happen to the company in terms of their security. This would be because the security that they would have would not be the best they they can get. But by no means do mean that the setup they have now is bad in anyway at all, it's just that it could be better. Due to this there is not much that I can add into this section as this already works very well. 

### Information access procedures
#### How is it used

When talking about information access there are many things that this could mean from how the information is accessed physically, logically and who can access the information. In this section I will be going with the later option. Who can actually access the information and for this I will be using the same document from the Oklahoma government to provide the examples, and they are as follows:

> 1. Information  access  is  subject  to  legal  restrictions  and  to  the  appropriate  approval processes  of  the  owning  State  Agency.  The  owning  State  Agency  is  responsible   for   maintaining   current   and   accurate   access   authorities   and   communicating these in an agreed upon manner to the security function at the State Agency hosting the information.
> 2. All agencies must designate a security representative whose role includes:
>  *	(A) communicating the information security Policy to all their respective agency's employees,
>  *	(B) communicating the appropriate procedures, guidelines and best practices to the responsible  user, owner, or people directly responsible for hosting activities as indicated in Attachment C,
>  *	(C) granting, on behalf of their agency, user access to system functions, and
>  *	(D)   reporting all deviations to the Policy, procedures, guidelines and best practices.

![Access to information image](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2410082/images/o-ACCESS-TO-INFORMATION-facebook.jpg)

As you can see this dictates how users are allowed to access the system and what restriction they will have and how one person is supposed to be there at all times to monitor them. The first part states how the access that users have to information is guided and ruled by one owning body and they handle how and who can access information. Part A goes on to say how the main monitoring person about how people access the system must state to everyone that they are in control of how they access the system well as how they can access the system. Part B goes on to say how this monitoring person should state exactly how all of the guidelines and policies that are surrounding their access to the system work. Part goes on to say that this monitoring person is giving all of the users to the system access to the system and its function on behalf of their agency. Finally, Part D says how all deviations from the rules of system access should immediately be reported so that this issue can be taken care of as quickly as possible to reduce possible damage to the system. 

#### Where it could be changed and improved

The way that I would change this is by ensuring that there are less monitoring people per number of regular staff. I think that this would be a good change as it would allow there to be a lower change for a monitoring person to defect and create quite bad situations. I say this as in business the vast majority of threats actually come from people who are inside the business and so having a relativity low number of people would be a good thing for security and would help keep the system secure. This will also become a lot easier with a good IT infrastructure where one person can manage all of the other people very easily no matter where they are and share thins information easily with them.  

#### The consequences of changing the policy 

With this change there would be a small change that would happen to the policy but overall it would not effect much. If a company where to switch to this method from the other one then they would just need to ensure that there is a suitable IT infrastructure in place that would facilitate the managing of many people's access in a system from one person or location. This will therefore lead to the company not having to pay out as much in terms of wages as they would have less people in higher paying positions, plus as they all have basically the same job then it would make sense that there should only be a few people doing the job. 

#### Consequences of not changing the policy

On the other hand, if the policy is not changed then there could be a higher potential for system failure or misuse. I say this as having more people than required in a high power job means that there are more people who could be trying to infiltrate the system and cause harm to it because most system attacks come from people who are in the company not from those outside. So this could lead to the system being compromised more frequently.  

### Information confidentiality 
#### How it is used

Information confidentiality is basically how the information that is generated by a system or the users of that system is protected by the law so that that information cannot be released anywhere else and that only certain people have access to the information. This will tie in with an airline agency as they would also have similar procedures to do with information on their systems. Below is an example of an IT security policy for the confidentiality of information. 

> 1.   The overriding premise is that all information hosted or created by a State Agency is  property  of  the  State.  As  such,  this  information  will  be  used  solely  for  performance of position related duties. Any transfers or disclosures are governed by this rule.
> 2. The confidentiality of all information created or hosted by a State Agency is the responsibility  of  all  State  Agencies.  Disclosure  is  governed  by  legislation,  regulatory protections, rules as well as policies and procedures of the State and of the owning State Agency. The highest of ethical standards are required to prevent the inappropriate transfer of sensitive or confidential information.
> 3. Release of information is strictly for job related functions. Confidentiality is compromised   when   knowingly   or   inadvertently,   information   crosses   the   boundaries of job related activities

![Confidential image](http://duration-driven.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ConfidentialInformation.png)

From this you can see that the first point covers how any of the information on the system is owner by the state and not by the individual user and as such it will treated as government property. The second part says how the information that the system holds is under the responsibility of all the users of that information , this would mean that if the information went missing then it would be the responsibility of the users, the users administrator and so on. This is because the information would be very sensitive and it just cant got out. Finally the last part says how information from the system can only be released as part of the job that he users doing and it cannot be released under another circumstances. 

#### Where it could be changed and improved. 

While overall this is a very solid policy there it just one change that I would make, and that would be to ensure that with information leaks that the people who are not involved with the information leak are not punished. Basically if someone that you are looking after for using the system leaks some information but you had nothing to do with this then you should not have the responsibility of that accident, it should be more re-directed to the person who actually leaked that information. Although this might create a situation where people don't try to keep the system as secure as it could be just because they know that they will not get in trouble if one of their people does, I don't think that this is a bad idea. But this will create an atmosphere where people would still  not try to leak information as it could get them fired and so they would still not want to do this. 

#### The consequences of changing the policy 

If the policy is changed then this would lead to a situation where users of the system would feel less likely to monitor what other people are doing on the system because they know that they would not get in trouble because of it. This would therefore mean that the overall productivity of users of the system is increased as they will spend more time on work and not on other people on the system. This is good as it will increase the work that actually get done in a given amount of time. In addition to this it could also raise worker morale as they know that they will not be blamed for something that they had nothing to do with. And this is also a good point from an ethical standpoint as you are being fair and correct in judgement.  

#### Consequences of not changing the policy

On the other hand of the policy was to not change then the users of the system would experience no change as that is how it currently works. But this would lead to comparatively lower productivity on the system as well as having people be more worried about using the system and how their people are using the system. Overall this would put it in a worse place compared to changing the policy, even if it done mean having a fractional decrease in system security, but it's not by a lot. 

### Conclusion 

As you can see here, all of these policies are good at the moment and they must work well as they are actually being used by a secure work place, but as with anything, there are ways that they can be improved. Even if these changes will have no effect on the place where theses policies reside in the government, it could have effects on other places where these are used like for an airline system as this will use similar policies. You can also also see a comparison of how these would effect the way the people work and use the security both in positive and negative ways. 

## Conclusion

As you can see, through this assignment have been through all the different types of policies that are in place for an IT  system and how they can relate to an airline organisation as they will need the IT security. I have also shown that I know hoe certain policies and acts work and how they actually relate in to the line of work and everyday tasks of employees who work in IT. Finally I have also shown that I know how ethical issues effect the work of IT people and how they can come to a compromise in terms of both situations, keeping the customers and the company both happy without braking the law.
