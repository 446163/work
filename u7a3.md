## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the different IT guidelines and policies that are around and govern the use of them as well as legislations and laws surrounding this area. 

## P4 - Create an illustrated report detailing the policies and guidelines that are used to manage IT security issues

In this section I will be going through different policies and guidelines that are in effect when you are managing IT security threats, for this I will be going through how these will effect my organisation of choice (Airlines) as well as some examples that would be found in colleges such as UTC reading. 

In this whole section I will be writing about the following:

* Software acquisition
* Internet and Email usage
* Data protection act and Copyright laws. 

### Software acquisition 

With any system that is holding private data there is an obvious need for the system to be secure so that the information is not released and so that people know their data will only be used how it is needed. Due to this fact the system will be needed to stay secure at all times so that no information can get out. This then requires all of the software on a system to be checked to ensure that it is using the data how it is supposed to and that there are no vulnerabilities that could leak the data. This will then require that all of the software on the system has been checked and is allowed to be there, this would all be managed by the IT people to ensure that all of the people using the system have access to all of the software that they would need whilst also ensuring that the system stays secure. And this is where the fist policy for secure system used in airlines would come into play: You are only allowed to install approved software on the system. 

With this in place the people using the airline system would not be allowed to install their own software onto it that could leak information like customer's bank details and so on. However these is the need for a certain balance with this although it would nor really effect the user too much especially on a very secure system. This is the balance between the software available for use and the security on the system, this needs to be right as on one side people would not be able to do what they want / need to do on the system while on the other hand information could be at risk. Although, on very secure systems this would be expected by all users so there might not be any problems with the lack of software as they can still (even at a very basic level) do what they need to do with the software on the system.  

For example, at UTC reading the students / staff do not have the correct level of access to install programs or applications on to the college's computers as when you try to install something it asks you for an administrator password that only the IT people know. This therefore means that the system stays secure as the users of the system cannot install their own programs but IT also allows for the administrator of the system to install application on an individual basis as they know the password. However, this is never done on practise as it would be a hassle to keep a track of and other people would also request to have the software as well. Instead the IT administrator use a system where the software is installed in the background on the machine over the college network. This will therefore mean that only a certain version of the software that the IT administrators have deemed safe would be installed on the computer and that the computer would still be able to be used throughout the installation process.  

### Internet and Email usage

Another main and important IT policy that is practised basically everywhere is the practice and policies that surround the use of internet and emails that are sued for work. In general this policy covers that fact that the users of the system (Internet and email systems) should only be allowed to use them for work reasons not personal and that all content that could be deemed not appropriate for work in any respect should not be done on these systems at work. For the first section of this part I will be writing about internet and in the second part I will be writing about emails. 

#### Internet usage

When at work the internet that users are granted access to should not be used for person issues / uses and should only be used for work / work related items. This will therefore allow for two different advantages for the users of the system even if they do not like it. The first is that the restriction on the internet would mean that users would be less likely to be distracted due to the fact that certain websites that they use will be blocked. This will mean that the users will be less distracted while they are at work and as such they will be more productive throughout the day. In addition to this the fact that the policy will block certain websites will also mean that the security if the organisation will stay in tact and the suers will not be able to get to content online that could pose a security threat. This is again quite similar to the installation of software limitations as it means that the users of the system will not be able to put the system at risk by having illegitimate content. 

For example, with this is place the users of the system would not be able to access sites such as Facebook or Reddit and so they will not be distracted and they will actually get on with more work throughout the day. Furthermore the fact that websites that will allow access to illegitimate programs are blocked means that the users of the system would not be able to download programs and such from Softonic and other download sites. This would then means the  in order to get software that could steal data and put the system a risk the users would have to use an external medium and that is more difficult to do accidentally. This would also be very detestation in a situation where the system is question is an airline one because there need to be secure because they hold very private information about customers that in addition to this the system that is in place will also have certain access to actually flight data and could alter the people on a flight and so on.... Furthermore the system will have be part of an intranet that the airline company uses to store and use their data in, if software that is run on a web browser managed to send information about the system through to other people then the intranet would be know and could then be abused by people or hacked. 

At UTC reading we have a similar policy in place as the internet that all of the people here can access is filtered so that people cannot access items that they are not allowed to while in work. Although the policy and regulations that we have here at UTC Reading are a bit more strict that would be at other places the main reasoning and policy remains. With the filter in place all the users of the internet here know that the internet that they have access to is being monitored so they cannot access all of the things that they could do while they are at home. For example we cannot access sites that would distract us like steam as we could then play games through college time rather than doing actual work. Furthermore download sites are also blocked like Softonic as with this users could download software that would not be good for the system that we have in place here. 

#### Email Usage

In most organisations the people who work there will get a work email address that is hosted by their work places and allows for them to communicate with all of the people who they might be working with. Due to the fact that the people will get this email account for free from their place of work the email generally has a policy surrounding it about how it can and cannot be used. In most cases this policy will restrict the usage of the email to be only for work related content much like the internet access as this will also be monitored by the company that you are working for to ensure that this is the case. However, in addition to this the company may also have further additional rules about how users use their work email account. One main one that often in place even non-officially is the fact that the users cannot use their work emails to harass or be mean to people and that they should only be used for good and work related content. Furthermore the company may also have a policy about how the users may need to delete all non-essential emails that they receive and empty the recycling bin of their account frequently. The reason that this last one may be necessary as because the organisation any have a limited storage space to actually store the emails that go through their work email accounts, due to this they request that the users clear as much space as they can on their accounts to accommodate other information that will have to be stored.  

For example when talking about an airline company then there will definitely be a system set in place for users of the system having their own work email address as the organisation would have to be quite large anyway so an email system would be no problem. In addition to this the airline company would also ensure that the content going through the emails would be appropriate for work because the nature of working with an airline company has security in mind and so the use of emails for non work purposes would not be allowed. In addition to this an airline company would also not allow the users of the email system to send harassing or mean messages through the email system. This would be due to the fact that at an airport it is supposed to be a friendly pace and also the harassing that people may be doing could be against the law and the company would obviously want to stop this. The final point here is not really a problem for an airline company due to the fact that they would have a lot of server space but it could come in to effect in some cases. This could be the case as some airlines may not have a large amount of free server space with their systems and databases already stored. As such this may come into effect and the emails service might automatically delete emails after a set amount of time. 

For example, at UTC Reading there is a system set up where all of the people at UTC will get a UTC college email address that they can use, however this is limited to only work / college related stuff as they are checked and go through a system. This is also the same for ensuring that the emails are not harassing people and so on.

### Data protection act 1990

 A final main IT policy that I will be writing about here is the data protection act of 1990 and how that will effect how the system is used with guidelines and policies. To start off with I will go through the data protect act an what it actually means. Below you will see a very brief summary of the data protection act from 
 
https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act:
 
> The Data Protection Act controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government.
> 
> Everyone responsible for using data has to follow strict rules called ‘data protection principles’. They must make sure the information is:
> 
>* used fairly and lawfully
>* used for limited, specifically stated purposes
>* used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive
>* accurate
>* kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary
>* handled according to people’s data protection rights
>* kept safe and secure
>* not transferred outside the European Economic Area without adequate protection
> 
> There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information, such as:
> 
>* ethnic background
>* political opinions
>* religious beliefs
>* health
>* sexual health
>* criminal records

The points described about should be very simple and obvious within themselves about what they mean but below I will briefly go through what they mean and what impacts they actually have upon these people storing the information.
