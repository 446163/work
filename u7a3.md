## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the different IT guidelines and policies that are around and govern the use of them as well as legislations and laws surrounding this area. 

## P4 - Create an illustrated report detailing the policies and guidelines that are used to manage IT security issues

In this section I will be going through different policies and guidelines that are in effect when you are managing IT security threats, for this I will be going through how these will effect my organisation of choice (Airlines) as well as some examples that would be found in colleges such as UTC Reading. 

In this whole section I will be writing about the following:

* Software acquisition
* Internet and Email usage
* Data protection act and Copyright laws. 

### Software acquisition 

With any system that is holding private data there is an obvious need for the system to be secure so that the information is not released and so that people know their data will only be used how it is needed. Due to this fact the system will be needed to stay secure at all times so that no information can get out. This then requires all of the software on a system to be checked to ensure that it is using the data how it is supposed to and that there are no vulnerabilities that could leak the data. This will then require that all of the software on the system has been checked and is allowed to be there, this would all be managed by the IT people to ensure that all of the people using the system have access to all of the software that they would need whilst also ensuring that the system stays secure. And this is where the fist policy for secure system used in airlines would come into play: You are only allowed to install approved software on the system. 

With this in place the people using the airline system would not be allowed to install their own software onto it that could leak information like customer's bank details and so on. However these is the need for a certain balance with this although it would nor really effect the user too much especially on a very secure system. This is the balance between the software available for use and the security on the system, this needs to be right as on one side people would not be able to do what they want / need to do on the system while on the other hand information could be at risk. Although, on very secure systems this would be expected by all users so there might not be any problems with the lack of software as they can still (even at a very basic level) do what they need to do with the software on the system.  

For example, at UTC reading the students / staff do not have the correct level of access to install programs or applications on to the college's computers as when you try to install something it asks you for an administrator password that only the IT people know. This therefore means that the system stays secure as the users of the system cannot install their own programs but IT also allows for the administrator of the system to install application on an individual basis as they know the password. However, this is never done on practise as it would be a hassle to keep a track of and other people would also request to have the software as well. Instead the IT administrator use a system where the software is installed in the background on the machine over the college network. This will therefore mean that only a certain version of the software that the IT administrators have deemed safe would be installed on the computer and that the computer would still be able to be used throughout the installation process.  

### Internet and Email usage

Another main and important IT policy that is practised basically everywhere is the practice and policies that surround the use of internet and emails that are sued for work. In general this policy covers that fact that the users of the system (Internet and email systems) should only be allowed to use them for work reasons not personal and that all content that could be deemed not appropriate for work in any respect should not be done on these systems at work. For the first section of this part I will be writing about internet and in the second part I will be writing about emails. 

#### Internet usage

When at work the internet that users are granted access to should not be used for person issues / uses and should only be used for work / work related items. This will therefore allow for two different advantages for the users of the system even if they do not like it. The first is that the restriction on the internet would mean that users would be less likely to be distracted due to the fact that certain websites that they use will be blocked. This will mean that the users will be less distracted while they are at work and as such they will be more productive throughout the day. In addition to this the fact that the policy will block certain websites will also mean that the security if the organisation will stay in tact and the suers will not be able to get to content online that could pose a security threat. This is again quite similar to the installation of software limitations as it means that the users of the system will not be able to put the system at risk by having illegitimate content. 

For example, with this is place the users of the system would not be able to access sites such as Facebook or Reddit and so they will not be distracted and they will actually get on with more work throughout the day. Furthermore the fact that websites that will allow access to illegitimate programs are blocked means that the users of the system would not be able to download programs and such from Softonic and other download sites. This would then means the  in order to get software that could steal data and put the system a risk the users would have to use an external medium and that is more difficult to do accidentally. This would also be very detestation in a situation where the system is question is an airline one because there need to be secure because they hold very private information about customers that in addition to this the system that is in place will also have certain access to actually flight data and could alter the people on a flight and so on.... Furthermore the system will have be part of an intranet that the airline company uses to store and use their data in, if software that is run on a web browser managed to send information about the system through to other people then the intranet would be know and could then be abused by people or hacked. 

At UTC reading we have a similar policy in place as the internet that all of the people here can access is filtered so that people cannot access items that they are not allowed to while in work. Although the policy and regulations that we have here at UTC Reading are a bit more strict that would be at other places the main reasoning and policy remains. With the filter in place all the users of the internet here know that the internet that they have access to is being monitored so they cannot access all of the things that they could do while they are at home. For example we cannot access sites that would distract us like steam as we could then play games through college time rather than doing actual work. Furthermore download sites are also blocked like Softonic as with this users could download software that would not be good for the system that we have in place here. 

#### Email Usage

In most organisations the people who work there will get a work email address that is hosted by their work places and allows for them to communicate with all of the people who they might be working with. Due to the fact that the people will get this email account for free from their place of work the email generally has a policy surrounding it about how it can and cannot be used. In most cases this policy will restrict the usage of the email to be only for work related content much like the internet access as this will also be monitored by the company that you are working for to ensure that this is the case. However, in addition to this the company may also have further additional rules about how users use their work email account. One main one that often in place even non-officially is the fact that the users cannot use their work emails to harass or be mean to people and that they should only be used for good and work related content. Furthermore the company may also have a policy about how the users may need to delete all non-essential emails that they receive and empty the recycling bin of their account frequently. The reason that this last one may be necessary as because the organisation any have a limited storage space to actually store the emails that go through their work email accounts, due to this they request that the users clear as much space as they can on their accounts to accommodate other information that will have to be stored.  

For example when talking about an airline company then there will definitely be a system set in place for users of the system having their own work email address as the organisation would have to be quite large anyway so an email system would be no problem. In addition to this the airline company would also ensure that the content going through the emails would be appropriate for work because the nature of working with an airline company has security in mind and so the use of emails for non work purposes would not be allowed. In addition to this an airline company would also not allow the users of the email system to send harassing or mean messages through the email system. This would be due to the fact that at an airport it is supposed to be a friendly pace and also the harassing that people may be doing could be against the law and the company would obviously want to stop this. The final point here is not really a problem for an airline company due to the fact that they would have a lot of server space but it could come in to effect in some cases. This could be the case as some airlines may not have a large amount of free server space with their systems and databases already stored. As such this may come into effect and the emails service might automatically delete emails after a set amount of time. 

For example, at UTC Reading there is a system set up where all of the people at UTC will get a UTC college email address that they can use, however this is limited to only work / college related stuff as they are checked and go through a system. This is also the same for ensuring that the emails are not harassing people and so on.

### Data protection act 1990

 A final main IT policy that I will be writing about here is the data protection act of 1990 and how that will effect how the system is used with guidelines and policies. To start off with I will go through the data protect act an what it actually means. Below you will see a very brief summary of the data protection act from 
 
https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act:
 
> The Data Protection Act controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government.
> 
> Everyone responsible for using data has to follow strict rules called ‘data protection principles’. They must make sure the information is:
> 
>* used fairly and lawfully
>* used for limited, specifically stated purposes
>* used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive
>* accurate
>* kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary
>* handled according to people’s data protection rights
>* kept safe and secure
>* not transferred outside the European Economic Area without adequate protection
> 
> There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information, such as:
> 
>* ethnic background
>* political opinions
>* religious beliefs
>* health
>* sexual health
>* criminal records

The points described about should be very simple and obvious within themselves about what they mean but below I will briefly go through what they mean and what impacts they actually have upon these people storing the information. 

To start off with, in general the data protection act is in place to protect the data that is stored about people by companies. This is done so that it will minimise the information that is stored so that in event of a disaster then not too much information will be released. However, it is also in place so that companies actually have enough information about their customers to be useful to them. 
The first point about be lawful and using the information fairly basically means that the information that the company collects about you should not be used for criminal purposes. The second point means that the information should only be used for what the user has agreed their information to be used for and nothing else unless the user agrees to that new part again. The third point here is similar to the previous point as it means that the data should only be used for what the user has agreed the data to be used for. The fourth point here means that the information must be kept accurate and up to date, this is so that the information is not incorrect as this could be quite bad for the user in the long run. One of the main points here is that the data must no be kept for for longer than it is needed, this is important as it means that once a customer no longer uses the companies product then they are not allowed to store the customers information. The next port basically means that the information must to handled in respect to the laws that I am reciting. The next one here says that the information must be kept safe and secure so that the information cannot be cases by people who should not have access to the information. The penultimate point here is that the information must not be transferred outside of the European Economic area, this is due to the way that the data protection act was created and how it is enforced but companies can transfer data between themselves with the users permission. The final point here is that certain information that's considered very private to people is under more strict legal protection as it is more private. 

So this must be followed when any organisation is storing information and MUST be kept to as it is a legal obligation. So this would be needed for an airline especially due to the type of customer information that they store so it should be a policy and guideline that is followed. 

## P4 - Creation of an illustrated report concentrating on how employment contracts can support or obstruct an organisation

In this Section I will be going through the advantages and disadvantages of employment contracts as well as what they actually are and how they effect people. 

To start off with I will be explaining what an employment contract actually is. For this I will be using the gov.uk website as this holds the actual definitions for the laws and provides a great summary. This was taken from the web page: https://www.gov.uk/employment-contracts-and-conditions/overview 

> All employees have an employment contract with their employer. A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee’s:
> 
>* employment conditions
>* rights
>* responsibilities
>* duties
> 
> These are called the ‘terms’ of the contract.
> 
> Employees and employers must stick to a contract until it ends (eg by an employer or employee giving notice or an employee being dismissed) or until the terms are changed (usually by agreement between the employee and employer).
> 
> If a person has an agreement to do some work for someone (like paint their house), this isn’t an employment contract but a ‘contract to provide services’.
> Accepting a contract
> 
> As soon as someone accepts a job offer they have a contract with their employer. An employment contract doesn’t have to be written down.

From this quotation above you can see that an employment contract is basically an agreement between the employer and the employee that dictates how well they are to be treated at the job and what they actually need to completed their job. This will therefore need to kept to as closely as a law because if this is broken then the employer could be violating one of the things listed above and if those are violated then that is the violation of a law and the employer could be prosecuted. 

As you can see this is a very good thing to have be done but there can also be certain drawbacks to this and in the next section I will be going through the advantages and the potential disadvantages of employment contracts.

### Advantages

When talking about employment contracts there are many advantages that they can have that will be beneficial to both the employer and the employee. The main advantage that this would bring to both sides of this would be that the initial terms and requirements of the contract are visible to both of the parties involved so there is complete transparency. This would therefore mean that both people would be able to spot any unfair conditions that would not be viable for the actual workplace and these can then be fixed before the employee starts working so that both sides get exactly what they want from the job. For example with this contract the employee could see that the work place would not be giving them adequate rights and that the conditions that they would have to work in would be in violation if human rights from this the employee would then know not to work for that company and save themselves. On the other hand the employer would then also be able to layout exactly what duties and responsibilities the employee would have and this could then be used as a contract in the future so that the employer would know what each of the employees should be doing whilst at work and if they are not doing that then they may be fired as they are no doing their job.  

In addition to this, another advantage of an employment contract is that it can be used as a legally binding contract for what the employer would have to provide for the employee so that they can actually work and do their job effectively. This would therefore mean that the employer would be able to do costs and accounting easier as they would know in advance what they will have to get for the employee and that there will be no more major additional costs. Furthermore this will also allow the employee to know what it is that they will have access to when they are doing the job and so they will be able to prepare for wheat they will be working with. This will be beneficial to both sides and allow them both to prepare for the new job. 

A final advantage of employment contracts is that the employer would be able to put in confidentiality clauses that would prohibit any employee from sharing or giving away trade secrets that only a certain company knows. With this in place the employer knows that the secrets will stay safe and this would allow the company to stay successful and not lose information. Without this in place the employee would be under no obligation to not share the information that is a trade secret to a certain company and this would then mean that they could give out the information if they wanted to and this could then give advantages in a certain industry away from s  specific company. 

This would come onto effect for an airline company a lot as it would mean that employees would know exactly what they are needed to do and when you are working as a part in IT this will be very helpful as it could be very easy for someone to give you a job related to what you do, but if you are not supposed to do that job then you could do it wrong. This could have many downsides and cause the security and integrity of the system to be at risk and this could then cause a massive It failure. Additionally, it will also allow the employer of an airline company to know exactly what each person should be doing and this could then mean that they will be able to know who is not doing the job that they are being paid for. Without this the employee could be getting away with not doing critical work on the IT system and without this it could go down and cause some downtime for the company. Finally it would also mean that the people who work for the IT sector are legally not allow
e to reveal the inner workings of the server and critical information like to anyone else and this could keep the system secure from attacks. 

### Disadvantages

However as with anything there is also some disadvantages to the system and these can have some adverse effects that  were not intended to happen. The main disadvantage that happens to employment contracts is that they are designed to last over a certain amount of time (say, 2 years or so) and the problem arises where the conditions of the employment have changed since its creation and as such the employment contract will need to be changed or the employee would need to be negotiated with. A main example of this would be if you hired an employee and in the contract it was written that you would have them for 2 years, but after only a year the employer found out that that particular employee is not needed anymore. At this stage there are two options that could go ahead, firstly, the employee and the employer could renegotiate the terms of the contract in such a way that they both feel happy with the result of, alternately the contract may have to be terminated, but in this case the employee would be able to take legal action against the employer as they have broken the contract that was in place and in this case the employee would most likely win the case and the employer would have to pay them to compensate. 

An additional disadvantage to the employment contract is that because it is a legally binding contract then if the wording is slightly ambiguous then other side would be able to exploit that fact and this could lead to bad things happening as they could technically be correct and this could lead to bad things happening with exploits. This could then lead to complicated court cases as people try to work out what was written in the contract and what exactly what it would mean. 

A final disadvantage is that the employment contract will limit the flexibility that the company has over the employee as if they want the employee to do something additional to what they are already set out to do in the contract then they will have to re-negotiate the whole contract in order to fit around the new role / job that this person will need to do. This can then lead to the company losing money over wasted time through this process and then this could lead to losses to the company that the would not have otherwise. 

For example at an airline company, This could be bad as the boss of people working for the IT section in an airline system could realise that some of the people that they have hired are not needed any more. This could have happened as there might have been a server migration project that would have required only a few IT engineers but if they accidentally got another person just to be sure or due to an error then they might have to got rid of them as they are not needed and the company would be wasting money.
