Hello, and welcome to my private work repository.

You now have special access to an otherwise hidden repo that it based on an Extended diploma in IT with a software specialism. :D

## The format of the repo

The files are formatted in a standard way with a few exceptions because there are some other files apart from BTEC work her. 

All BTEC work will follow the naming scheme as follows:

### Assignments 

> u***x***a***y***.md

With this meaning...

* The ***x*** represent the unit number (Unit 7, 30...etc)
* The ***y*** represents the assignment for that particular unit (Assignment 1, 2...etc)
* The ***u*** and ***a*** are for ***u***nit and ***a***assignment. 
* The .md indicates that you are accessing the correct file and that it is written in markdown (so it formats nicely)

### Briefs

In addition to this I also have the assignment briefs for some of the assignments here as well and these will be laid out like so:

> u***x***a***y*****b**

With the additional b on the end meaning...

* The **b** indicates that it is the brief of the assignment. 
* The brief may also contain notes about what the teacher has said about that particular criteria as well as the actual content that is to be covered. 
* The notes will be separated by the actual content by a line break but they will be deferrable by context. 
* These may or may not have the .md file type as it depends how I create it.

### Notes

The last type of standard file in this repo is the notes file and this is laid out like so:

> u***x***a***y*****n**-**name**

As before this layout indicates that:

* The ***x*** and ***y*** indicate the number of the unit and assignment. 
* The \"u\" and \"a\" stand for unit and assignment.
* The **n** stands for the notes file (rather than **b** for the brief) so yo know you have the correct file.
* The name will be the name for the actual assignment title for that unit (Not for the assignment!!!).
* These may or may not have the .md file type as it depends how I create it.

*Important notice about the notes*

* The notes file is used for general notes / ideas of all assignments in the unit not just 1.
* This will generally be less helpful and might not make sense but you can still look at it if you want to. 

## Images

I also store all of the images that I use in the assignments in this repo and these are stored as follows:

> u***n***img/

This is a folder that the images are contained in as this works very similarly as the previous items: 

* The \"u\" stands for unit. 
* The ***n*** stands for the unit number (e.g. 30, 29...etc).
* It is a folder containing the images, not a file.
* The folder may be split more into specific categories for each assignment or for the original and used images etc..
* The subfolders will be named according to their actual use as you will see. 

## Usage

You may use this repo to view and get ideas about assignments that you may be stuck or confused about. *However, there are some important rules that you have to follow!*

* No copying of content - this is my work and so you would be plagiarising if you were to copy it and claim it as your own, not only would this fail me but it would fail you as well

* No changing the content / deleting items - This repo is the actual one that I use for sharing work between computers and this is where my work is backed up fully, if you change this I lose my work.

* No inviting others - if you want someone else to access this repo then just ask me as I will most likely say yes, but you need to ask me and I will add them. 

> **The breaking of these basic rules could result in you being banned from this repo or it could lead to the complete remove of everyone else as well so please use it well**

## Additional features

However, there are some additional features about this repo that could benefit all of us using it.

* If you stop a typo or a mistake then just create an issue about it and I will see it and fix it when I can.
* If you want to question me about something to do with this then you can create an issue for that a well and I will answer when I can. 

So that is it really, hope you find this useful and it helps you with your BTEC in the end...
