The task you were set | To create a raspberyy pi controled RGBLed that could be accessed by a web interface
What did you achieve during the day (be specific, what tasks did you manage to get done | we set up the raspberry pi and got it to control the LED with a script. We then also set up a web server that would ask for user input and write in into a database that the raspberry pi could read from.  
What do you need to do next time to improve (Again, be specific - are there particular tasks you need to complete, things that you or others in your group need to do?) | Next time I think that we should get the web server set up quicker so that we could test out the raspberry pi sooner.
Overall reflection | It went quite well as we beery nearly managed to get it all set up and working, but we just ran out of time.
