## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through how the internet and websites actually work with all the tools and how all of the different parts are actually connected and what part they serve. In addition to this I will also be going through the different security that is in place for you and the website as well as how the performance of the website is actually effected by the users and the host of the content. 


P1 - Outline the web architecture and components which enable internet and web functionality

In this section I will be going through the different components that are available and that actually help you to get information from a server on-line. The components that I will be going through are as follows:

 * Internet service provider
 * Web hosing services
 * domain structure
 * domain name registrar
 * World wide web
 * web server
 * mail server
 * proxy server
 * browser
 * email
 * TCP/IP
 * Application layer e.g HTTP, MTP
 * Flow Diagram

## Internet service provider

When connection to the internet, your internet service provider (ISP) is the company who is actually responsible for connecting you to the internet and the rest of the computers that are connect to it. They do this by having lines in the ground that actually connect all of the computers that they serve so that they have a massive network of computers that are all connected together, and that is basically the internet. However, these companies also link into all the other companies that are ISP'S as well so that they can connect all of the computers on this massive network that we call the internet. The reasons that you could not just set up your own ISP easily is because of the infrastructure that is require and is in place like all the cables, control centres, servers and so on... Some examples of these companies would be BT ,Sky, Virgin media and so on.  
 
## Web hosing services

A web hosting service is a service that actually hosts and servers the customers to the website that you create. It may help to think of them as the physical store to a product that you have created. They will provide the hardware and access to the item (website) but you will hive to supply them with the item in the first place. They will manage the upkeep of the actual store and the ability that customers have to access it. However, they will require a fee from the you to actually keep the limited shelf storage filled with your item. This means that the web hosting service will provide you with a server that they own to run the website that you have created, due to this they will be supplying the server hardware to run it as well as the internet connection that is used to access the site that you have created. It is also up to them to ensure that the server your website is running on is actually fit for purpose and not in a condition where it cooed fail, likewise the same must be considered for the internet connection. Some examples of name brands would be 1&1, 123.reg and godaddy. 
 
## domain structure

The domain structure is the way that the website actually organises the sub websites and the parts of the website in a way that they can all be accessed under the same website name. A main example of this would be googles translate service as that is at the web address of www.translate.google.com. As you can see here the main name of the website belongs to google as it is www.translate.*google.com* this is know as a sub-domain of the website as it is the same website but it is just a different part of it and in this case it is the translation part of googles website. The layout of this is always the same as it always has the sub-domain leading the domain name separated by a dot. This is also present as another example on wordpress sites as they are also mywebsite.wordpress.com. In addition to this websites also have a standard for how files that they host are accessed, this is done by having the domain name followed by the directory of the file like it would be on any computer with the directories separated by slashes. An example of this could be mywebsite.wordpress.com:/files/images/123.jpg as you can see the first part basically tells your computer where to get the file from and then the second part tills you computer how to get to the file from its storage location. 
 
## domain name registrar

The domain name registrar is the organisation that deals with, and manages internet domain name, which are the names of servers that you can access online. The way that this works is that when you type in www.google.com into your browser that will go off to a domain name server and this will then concert that name into an actual ip address that is used to access and find googles server, the ip address could look like this :"62.252.191.231". The domain name register are the people who keep the domain name servers in check and ensure that they are correct. From Wikipedia, the initial description is as follows:

> A domain name registrar is an organization or commercial entity that manages the reservation of Internet domain names. A domain name registrar must be accredited by a generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry and/or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry. The management is done in accordance with the guidelines of the designated domain name registries. 

Without the domain name registrar, the domain name servers could not be in place as there would be differences between then and multiple people could have the same name and that would cause a lot of problems...
 
## World wide web

The world wide web is the name for the network that identifies resources through URLs (Universal retrieval links) and is accessed through the internet. It it also called the web but is not the same as the internet. The ways that they are different is that the world wide web is how the resources are accessed while the internet is the network of computers that are all connected together and share the information. From Wikipedia, the definition is as follows:

> The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer programme in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.

As you can see this goes through the same thing as I mentioned how the web is where the information is stored. 
 
## web server

One of the most important components for having the web function is the use of web servers. A web server is a computer that is set up to process and serve requests that happen through http which is the protocol that the world wide web uses. The term web server can refer to both the actual, physical machine as well as the software that the machine is running as that software is the actual part that serves the requests. There are all different types of web servers that will handle all types of information and will serve all types of requests, however the main type of web server will be one that will send web pages based on the requests that is receives from http. Due to this it will also have to manage the sessions of each of its users with keeping their connection alive and sending them the correct information. 
 
## mail server

A mail server is a computer that is set up to receive emails and have an account / many accounts set up with it. This is used for when you don't want to or cant use an online mail service like hotmail or gmail. This mail server will primarily be used for the storage and retrieval of emails but can also be setup for the use of internal / private accounts for example at an organisation. This is because when you own a business and therefor a website for that company and so you can set an email server up for you organisation so that you can have internal private emails like Jack.johnson@mywebsite.com rather than Jack.johnson@hotmail.com. In addition to this you van set up very specific rules about who can email who and so on that you would not be able to do otherwise. Finally, because you are running the server by yourself you can ensure that you only allow internal email addresses and to you can cut out all emails from the rest of the internet that could be spam and not useful at all to you. 
 
## proxy server

The final type of server that I will be writing about is proxy servers. These are a special server that is not used for processing but is instead used to redirect traffic through the internet. The best way to think about this is instead of accessing the server you want to directly, you instead access it by first going through the proxy server and then to the server that you want to access. In this image below, you can see what I mean by this:

![Proxy Server](http://cdn.whatismyipaddress.com/images-v4/proxy-server.png)

In this image, you can see a comparison between the two different methods of using and not using a proxy server. When not using a proxy the process is as you would expect, you connect to the server you want and it gets your ip address to know where to send the information to, from this the server can get some information about you like your location and to on. Additionally, if the router / network that you are using blocks you from accessing the server then you will not be able to access it as it blocks you as soon as it sees the connection to that server. On the other hand, if you are using a proxy server then all your information will go through the proxy server rather that your device. This will then mean that the server you are trying to access will get the proxy servers ip address, not your one. This will mean that the server you want to access will have to get information from the proxy servers ip rather than your device, this then means that the server could think that you are from a different country if you and your proxy are in different places. In addition to this, if the network that you are on blocks access to the server that you want then when you use a proxy the network won't block you as you are not blocked from the proxy server so it will go through fine with no problems and you can access the server you want to. 
 
## browser

In order to actually access content that is provided on the world wide web, you need to be able to browse with the internet and as such you will need software installed on your computer that can actually do that, and this is what is called a web browser. The main function of this software is to concert the HTML code that websites are created and programmed in and turn that into an actual nice looking interface like the programmers intended it to look like. HTML is what is called a markup language, this is because instead of programming  logic and reason into the code it is designed to logically layout elements on a screen and that is in the name of HTML as Hyper Text Markup Language .Although that is the main function of the browser, they will have may additional features from managing websites, to plugins to playing different video files and so on. Some examples of popular browsers would be Firebox (made by Mozilla), Chrome (made by Google) and Edge (made by Microsoft). 
 
## email

One of the main methods of communication that is used with in the world wide web and the internet is email. This is the process where you send messages to people via a website name that they have an account associated with, when you send an email to Recipient@website.com the email will get to them as it is forwarded through certain ports and routing. At the other end there will be a mail program that will capture that email you sent and will then allow the person you sent it to. All of this goes through different ports on the internet depending on what the information being sent is. 
 
## TCP/IP

TCP/IP is the current language and protocol that is used for the sending and receiving of information on modern networks with modern machines. It contains the rules and information about how information is to be packed, transported and received along with how the message needs to be responded to and networks layout out. The way that the information is sent is through through the technique of cutting splitting the information into smaller parts called packets that are then sent individually across the internet. This means that all the packets could take a different path through the internet and different routers to get to their destination, when they eventually reach the other side they art then reassembled into the correct order and put back to the original file / information. This is then the format / standard for how all information is to be transmitted through the internet and this is the basic way that all modern  information is transmitted. 
 
## Application layer e.g HTTP, MTP

the application layer is a layer in the TCP/IP model and it is responsible for the protocols and interface that the any TCP/IP network uses, this is also included in the OSI network model but it is called the session layer but it does a similar function. When I say that it deals with the protocols and interface I mean that in an TCP/IP network the application layer contains the way that the information is transferred and managed by process to process communication as it defines the standard that the information must use. However, when used as part of the OSI standard, the term application layer is used as the user interface for actually looking as and viewing the information that has been received. The actual protocols that are used as past of the application layer are too long to count, but they are basically the protocols that are high level and are the more interactive ones that get the user interaction. Some examples of this would be:

 * http (webpages)
 * ssh (secure shell access to a server)
 * ftp (file transfer protocol)
 * pop (mail server)
 * dns (domain name server)
 * and so on...

As you can see, all of these are used by processes to other processes and because they are so high level some of these should be recognisable.
