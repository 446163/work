## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through how the internet and websites actually work with all the tools and how all of the different parts are actually connected and what part they serve. In addition to this I will also be going through the different security that is in place for you and the website as well as how the performance of the website is actually effected by the users and the host of the content. 


## P1 - Outline the web architecture and components which enable internet and web functionality

In this section I will be going through the different components that are available and that actually help you to get information from a server on-line. The components that I will be going through are as follows:

 * Internet service provider
 * Web hosing services
 * domain structure
 * domain name registrar
 * World wide web
 * web server
 * mail server
 * proxy server
 * browser
 * email
 * TCP/IP
 * Application layer e.g HTTP, MTP
 * Flow Diagram

### Internet service provider

When connection to the internet, your internet service provider (ISP) is the company who is actually responsible for connecting you to the internet and the rest of the computers that are connect to it. They do this by having lines in the ground that actually connect all of the computers that they serve so that they have a massive network of computers that are all connected together, and that is basically the internet. However, these companies also link into all the other companies that are ISP'S as well so that they can connect all of the computers on this massive network that we call the internet. The reasons that you could not just set up your own ISP easily is because of the infrastructure that is require and is in place like all the cables, control centres, servers and so on... Some examples of these companies would be BT ,Sky, Virgin media and so on.  
 
## Web hosting services

A web hosting service is a service that actually hosts and servers the customers to the website that you create. It may help to think of them as the physical store to a product that you have created. They will provide the hardware and access to the item (website) but you will hive to supply them with the item in the first place. They will manage the upkeep of the actual store and the ability that customers have to access it. However, they will require a fee from the you to actually keep the limited shelf storage filled with your item. This means that the web hosting service will provide you with a server that they own to run the website that you have created, due to this they will be supplying the server hardware to run it as well as the internet connection that is used to access the site that you have created. It is also up to them to ensure that the server your website is running on is actually fit for purpose and not in a condition where it cooed fail, likewise the same must be considered for the internet connection. Some examples of name brands would be 1&1, 123.reg and godaddy. 
 
### domain structure

The domain structure is the way that the website actually organises the sub websites and the parts of the website in a way that they can all be accessed under the same website name. A main example of this would be google's translate service as that is at the web address of www.translate.google.com. As you can see here the main name of the website belongs to google as it is www.translate.*google.com* this is know as a sub-domain of the website as it is the same website but it is just a different part of it and in this case it is the translation part of google's website. The layout of this is always the same as it always has the sub-domain leading the domain name separated by a dot. This is also present as another example on wordpress sites as they are also mywebsite.wordpress.com. In addition to this websites also have a standard for how files that they host are accessed, this is done by having the domain name followed by the directory of the file like it would be on any computer with the directories separated by slashes. An example of this could be mywebsite.wordpress.com:/files/images/123.jpg as you can see the first part basically tells your computer where to get the file from and then the second part tills you computer how to get to the file from its storage location. 
 
### domain name registrar

The domain name registrar is the organisation that deals with, and manages internet domain name, which are the names of servers that you can access online. The way that this works is that when you type in www.google.com into your browser that will go off to a domain name server and this will then concert that name into an actual ip address that is used to access and find google's server, the ip address could look like this :"62.252.191.231". The domain name register are the people who keep the domain name servers in check and ensure that they are correct. From Wikipedia, the initial description is as follows:

> A domain name registrar is an organization or commercial entity that manages the reservation of Internet domain names. A domain name registrar must be accredited by a generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry and/or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry. The management is done in accordance with the guidelines of the designated domain name registries. 

Without the domain name registrar, the domain name servers could not be in place as there would be differences between then and multiple people could have the same name and that would cause a lot of problems...
 
### World wide web

The world wide web is the name for the network that identifies resources through URLs (Universal retrieval links) and is accessed through the internet. It it also called the web but is not the same as the internet. The ways that they are different is that the world wide web is how the resources are accessed while the internet is the network of computers that are all connected together and share the information. From Wikipedia, the definition is as follows:

> The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer programme in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.

As you can see this goes through the same thing as I mentioned how the web is where the information is stored. 
 
### web server

One of the most important components for having the web function is the use of web servers. A web server is a computer that is set up to process and serve requests that happen through http which is the protocol that the world wide web uses. The term web server can refer to both the actual, physical machine as well as the software that the machine is running as that software is the actual part that serves the requests. There are all different types of web servers that will handle all types of information and will serve all types of requests, however the main type of web server will be one that will send web pages based on the requests that is receives from http. Due to this it will also have to manage the sessions of each of its users with keeping their connection alive and sending them the correct information. 
 
### mail server

A mail server is a computer that is set up to receive emails and have an account / many accounts set up with it. This is used for when you don't want to or cant use an online mail service like hotmail or gmail. This mail server will primarily be used for the storage and retrieval of emails but can also be setup for the use of internal / private accounts for example at an organisation. This is because when you own a business and therefor a website for that company and so you can set an email server up for you organisation so that you can have internal private emails like Jack.johnson@mywebsite.com rather than Jack.johnson@hotmail.com. In addition to this you van set up very specific rules about who can email who and so on that you would not be able to do otherwise. Finally, because you are running the server by yourself you can ensure that you only allow internal email addresses and to you can cut out all emails from the rest of the internet that could be spam and not useful at all to you. 
 
### proxy server

The final type of server that I will be writing about is proxy servers. These are a special server that is not used for processing but is instead used to redirect traffic through the internet. The best way to think about this is instead of accessing the server you want to directly, you instead access it by first going through the proxy server and then to the server that you want to access. In this image below, you can see what I mean by this:

![Proxy Server](http://cdn.whatismyipaddress.com/images-v4/proxy-server.png)

In this image, you can see a comparison between the two different methods of using and not using a proxy server. When not using a proxy the process is as you would expect, you connect to the server you want and it gets your ip address to know where to send the information to, from this the server can get some information about you like your location and to on. Additionally, if the router / network that you are using blocks you from accessing the server then you will not be able to access it as it blocks you as soon as it sees the connection to that server. On the other hand, if you are using a proxy server then all your information will go through the proxy server rather that your device. This will then mean that the server you are trying to access will get the proxy servers ip address, not your one. This will mean that the server you want to access will have to get information from the proxy servers ip rather than your device, this then means that the server could think that you are from a different country if you and your proxy are in different places. In addition to this, if the network that you are on blocks access to the server that you want then when you use a proxy the network won't block you as you are not blocked from the proxy server so it will go through fine with no problems and you can access the server you want to. 
 
### browser

In order to actually access content that is provided on the world wide web, you need to be able to browse with the internet and as such you will need software installed on your computer that can actually do that, and this is what is called a web browser. The main function of this software is to concert the HTML code that websites are created and programmed in and turn that into an actual nice looking interface like the programmers intended it to look like. HTML is what is called a markup language, this is because instead of programming  logic and reason into the code it is designed to logically layout elements on a screen and that is in the name of HTML as Hyper Text Markup Language .Although that is the main function of the browser, they will have may additional features from managing websites, to plugins to playing different video files and so on. Some examples of popular browsers would be Firebox (made by Mozilla), Chrome (made by Google) and Edge (made by Microsoft). 
 
### email

One of the main methods of communication that is used with in the world wide web and the internet is email. This is the process where you send messages to people via a website name that they have an account associated with, when you send an email to Recipient@website.com the email will get to them as it is forwarded through certain ports and routing. At the other end there will be a mail program that will capture that email you sent and will then allow the person you sent it to. All of this goes through different ports on the internet depending on what the information being sent is. 
### TCP/IP 
TCP/IP is the current language and protocol that is used for the sending and receiving of information on modern networks with modern machines. It contains the rules and information about how information is to be packed, transported and received along with how the message needs to be responded to and networks layout out. The way that the information is sent is through through the technique of cutting splitting the information into smaller parts called packets that are then sent individually across the internet. This means that all the packets could take a different path through the internet and different routers to get to their destination, when they eventually reach the other side they art then reassembled into the correct order and put back to the original file / information. This is then the format / standard for how all information is to be transmitted through the internet and this is the basic way that all modern  information is transmitted. 
 
### Application layer e.g HTTP, MTP

the application layer is a layer in the TCP/IP model and it is responsible for the protocols and interface that the any TCP/IP network uses, this is also included in the OSI network model but it is called the session layer but it does a similar function. When I say that it deals with the protocols and interface I mean that in an TCP/IP network the application layer contains the way that the information is transferred and managed by process to process communication as it defines the standard that the information must use. However, when used as part of the OSI standard, the term application layer is used as the user interface for actually looking as and viewing the information that has been received. The actual protocols that are used as past of the application layer are too long to count, but they are basically the protocols that are high level and are the more interactive ones that get the user interaction. Some examples of this would be:

 * http (webpages)
 * ssh (secure shell access to a server)
 * ftp (file transfer protocol)
 * pop (mail server)
 * dns (domain name server)
 * and so on...

As you can see, all of these are used by processes to other processes and because they are so high level some of these should be recognisable. 
 
### Flow Diagram

In this subsection I will be showing a few diagrams that help explain how the internet actually works and how the information actually goes from the application you are using, down to the signals on the wire ant now it is then sent to another machine and how that machine gets the information again. In the diagram below you can see how both the packets are made as well as how the packets are sent:

![TCP/IF diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/IP_stack_connections.svg/350px-IP_stack_connections.svg.png)

As you can see, the image above shows how the packets make it through the internet as well as how the packets are actually put into packets through the network stack.

The first section of this image is easy to explain so I will start off with that. As explained previously, the way that information is actually sent is through the use of packets. A packet is just where the information that needs to be sent has been split up into very small parts that are only a few kilobytes in size. This is done so that if some of the information does not make it to the other side then the program can still carry on. This then works well with another fact about how packets work, and that is that all the packets are sent individually through the internet, not all as one massive group. This is good for many, many reasons but a few would be that all of the information does not have to be available at once and so it can be sent as a continuous stream and as you can imagine this can open up many possibilities like multilayer games and livestreams. However due to the fact that the information is being split up like this, some of the information might not make it and some of the information might not be in the correct order like it was when it was sent, due to both of these the program that is receiving the information will have to be able to handle these imperfections with the information, but this is fine as the standard for how the information should be sent though packets insures that all of the packets are numbered so that they can be re-ordered. In the first part of the diagram above you can see how in order for the packet to get to the other computer via the internet it will have to travel through routers to get through, and this is the same for all packets and so if there is another way to get to the destination using the routers then the packets could take a different route and arrive at different times. 

In the second part of the image you can see how the actual information will travel through the different parts of the TCP/IP stack that is inside your computer to actually get to the other computer where it then goes back up the stack but in reverse so that it is put back into actual information. I will not be going though how all of these layers actually work because that will require another assignment in itself, but basically each stage will get the information further down to a state where it can be transmitted as actual signals along the wire. In addition to this, the second stage that you see between the LAN and the internet are processes that are performed by the router that connects your private network to the internet. 

this is the process that is required to get the information that you want from a serves to your screen. The process goes as follows:

 * you request information from a server by clicking a web in the web browser that you are using. 
 * the information goes through the TCP/IP stack that is built into your computer and gets put into actual signals on the Ethernet wire. 
 * the packets then go to a domain name server so that they can get an ip address to the name of the website.
 * the packets that you sent make their way to you ISP (Internet Service Provider) and they then send those packets to the world wide web.
 * the packets that you sent find there way to the web hosting provider for the website.
 * the packets are then received by the web server and this processes your request and gives you a session. 
 * it then send back the information from the correct part of the domain structure that website has.


## P2 - Explain the user side and server side factors that influence the performance of a website

In this section I will go through the different factors that influence the performance of a website for both the server and the client as well as how these factors can be negated as much as possible. 

### server side factors

When connecting to a web server, there are many different things that will effect the performance and a few of these factors will be due to the server rather than the user. A few examples of these factors that I will explain are:

 * Web server capacities
 * available bandwidth
 * number of hits
 * file types

#### Web Server capabilities

One main factor that is easy to think of if a website if performing badly is the power of the hardware that the web server is running on. Obviously, if the web server is running on a very old server then the performance of the website will not be good as the hardware cannot keep up with the requests that are being made. However, the hardware that the server is running on will need to be suitable for the website that the web server is actually running. For example if you are hosting a small website that you made then it would run fine on an old computer in your room or a desktop. In this case it would be far too much to get multiple servers set up. On the other hand, if you are hosting a really large website like Google, then a few servers would be no where near enough as you would need thousands of servers to run the website. In conclusion, you a web server should always use the right amount of hardware for the website that it is hosting with more powerful hardware producing a better experience but past a certain point is will become cost ineffective. This would then create a website that will be very slow and will spend a lot of time loading for the customers. 

#### Available bandwidth

Another factor that effects the web server and its ability to give high performance is the amount of bandwidth that it has access to and how much of this is being used. The bandwidth is the amount of information that it can send / receive at the same time, if you think of the internet access a computer has as a hose then the bandwidth is the diameter of the hose, and as it is increased the computer can send and receive more information at the same time. This will only be a problem if there is not enough bandwidth available to the server as it would not be able to serve all of its customers the information that they require and the will effect the performance greatly. If there is not enough bandwidth available then the server will have to buffer the information that it wants to send and this will mean that the users of the website will have to wait a long time to get the information that they want and this would create a bad user experience as the website would be laggy and non-responsive. 

#### Number of hits

to start off with, the number of hits that a website gets is just the number of people that visit the website, this can be used to measure how popular a website is as with more hits the website will have more people visiting it and will be more popular. The problem with getting a large number of hits is that the bandwidth the server has access to will be filled up, and in addition to this the server will have to keep track of many sessions and this could overload the server and cause the server to crash or it could cause the server to not accept any new connections. of course, this is not very likely to happen, but if it does then it could be catastrophic. To ensure that this does not happen you should ensure that you have the correct number of servers set up for your website so that if one gets too busy then you can offload some of the work to another server that you have so that the website remains usable. If this were to happen to a website that you are using then you would know as the website would get slower and slower until the website would crash or stop all information from accessing it and effectively kick you off.  

#### file types

A final factor that I will go through that is not very often thought of are the file types that the server uses and the size of them as well as the ease of use that they have. The main factor here is the size of the files that the server is using and sending. For example, if you had a website that would play small audio clips that are not of the highest quality then you would want the audio to be stored as a small file size like a compressed mp3 rather than something like a lossless flac file that is normally used for high end audio and will normally be tens to hundreds of times the size. If the website chose to use just the flac files then they would take a lot longer to download on the users machine and would provide no benefit for the download cost. Another reason is that if the server uses files that are hard to work with and take a while to write to then it will also be slow. In the end if the sever uses the incorrect file types then the loading of the website can take a while and this could put some customers off the website. 

### User side factors

when measuring the performance of a web server you need to consider the user side factors just as much as the server side factors to that you get a fair assessment, below I will go through a few of these factors:

 * download speed
 * PC performance
 	* browser
	* cache
	* processor

#### Download speed

The main factor that will influence the perceived speed of a web page for a user would be the download speed that they have. This is a measure of how quickly the users machine will be able to download files and this is measured in the number of megabits that the computer cat download per second, for reference a very good measure would be 100 mbps. This then means that with a higher download speed the user would be able to download the content from the website faster and would have a better experience. On the other hand, if the user has a bad download speed then they would not be able to access the website's content fast at all and this would result in the user having a bad experience. Although this cannot be solved completely, the server should look to ensure that all the content that it wants to send is  as small as it can get whilst still having the website look and behave as intended. 

#### PC performance

The computer that the user is running will effect the performance that they will get from the website, and there are a few main things that will effect this and those are the browser, cache and processor. The browser is the past that will actually convert the code that the developers created into how they wanted it to look, with a more modern browser the conversion will be quicker as there are new ways to convert the code created. In addition to this, a newer browser will enable new website technologies to run that can be used to create better websites. Next there is the cache, this is a part of the browser that stores parts of websites that you have visited so that you don't have to re-download that past again. With cache this will improve the user experience as the download when visiting a website again will be less and so it will load faster and give better performance. Finally, there is the actual processor or CPU of the computer, and this will have the largest impact as with a better processor the user will be able to convert the website faster as well as be able to convert many more things at once and this will lead to a faster experience by a large amount.
