## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through how the internet and websites actually work with all the tools and how all of the different parts are actually connected and what part they serve. In addition to this I will also be going through the different security that is in place for you and the website as well as how the performance of the website is actually effected by the users and the host of the content. 


## P1 - Outline the web architecture and components which enable internet and web functionality

In this section I will be going through the different components that are available and that actually help you to get information from a server on-line. The components that I will be going through are as follows:

 * Internet service provider
 * Web hosing services
 * domain structure
 * domain name registrar
 * World wide web
 * web server
 * mail server
 * proxy server
 * browser
 * email
 * TCP/IP
 * Application layer e.g HTTP, MTP
 * Flow Diagram

### Internet service provider

When connection to the internet, your internet service provider (ISP) is the company who is actually responsible for connecting you to the internet and the rest of the computers that are connect to it. They do this by having lines in the ground that actually connect all of the computers that they serve so that they have a massive network of computers that are all connected together, and that is basically the internet. However, these companies also link into all the other companies that are ISP'S as well so that they can connect all of the computers on this massive network that we call the internet. The reasons that you could not just set up your own ISP easily is because of the infrastructure that is require and is in place like all the cables, control centres, servers and so on... Some examples of these companies would be BT ,Sky, Virgin media and so on.  
 
### Web hosting services

A web hosting service is a service that actually hosts and servers the customers to the website that you create. It may help to think of them as the physical store to a product that you have created. They will provide the hardware and access to the item (website) but you will hive to supply them with the item in the first place. They will manage the upkeep of the actual store and the ability that customers have to access it. However, they will require a fee from the you to actually keep the limited shelf storage filled with your item. This means that the web hosting service will provide you with a server that they own to run the website that you have created, due to this they will be supplying the server hardware to run it as well as the internet connection that is used to access the site that you have created. It is also up to them to ensure that the server your website is running on is actually fit for purpose and not in a condition where it cooed fail, likewise the same must be considered for the internet connection. Some examples of name brands would be 1&1, 123.reg and godaddy. 
 
### domain structure

The domain structure is the way that the website actually organises the sub websites and the parts of the website in a way that they can all be accessed under the same website name. A main example of this would be google's translate service as that is at the web address of www.translate.google.com. As you can see here the main name of the website belongs to google as it is www.translate.*google.com* this is know as a sub-domain of the website as it is the same website but it is just a different part of it and in this case it is the translation part of google's website. The layout of this is always the same as it always has the sub-domain leading the domain name separated by a dot. This is also present as another example on wordpress sites as they are also mywebsite.wordpress.com. In addition to this websites also have a standard for how files that they host are accessed, this is done by having the domain name followed by the directory of the file like it would be on any computer with the directories separated by slashes. An example of this could be mywebsite.wordpress.com:/files/images/123.jpg as you can see the first part basically tells your computer where to get the file from and then the second part tills you computer how to get to the file from its storage location. 
 
### domain name registrar

The domain name registrar is the organisation that deals with, and manages internet domain name, which are the names of servers that you can access online. The way that this works is that when you type in www.google.com into your browser that will go off to a domain name server and this will then concert that name into an actual ip address that is used to access and find google's server, the ip address could look like this :"62.252.191.231". The domain name register are the people who keep the domain name servers in check and ensure that they are correct. From Wikipedia, the initial description is as follows:

> A domain name registrar is an organization or commercial entity that manages the reservation of Internet domain names. A domain name registrar must be accredited by a generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry and/or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry. The management is done in accordance with the guidelines of the designated domain name registries. 

Without the domain name registrar, the domain name servers could not be in place as there would be differences between then and multiple people could have the same name and that would cause a lot of problems...
 
### World wide web

The world wide web is the name for the network that identifies resources through URLs (Universal retrieval links) and is accessed through the internet. It it also called the web but is not the same as the internet. The ways that they are different is that the world wide web is how the resources are accessed while the internet is the network of computers that are all connected together and share the information. From Wikipedia, the definition is as follows:

> The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer programme in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.

As you can see this goes through the same thing as I mentioned how the web is where the information is stored. 
 
### web server

One of the most important components for having the web function is the use of web servers. A web server is a computer that is set up to process and serve requests that happen through http which is the protocol that the world wide web uses. The term web server can refer to both the actual, physical machine as well as the software that the machine is running as that software is the actual part that serves the requests. There are all different types of web servers that will handle all types of information and will serve all types of requests, however the main type of web server will be one that will send web pages based on the requests that is receives from http. Due to this it will also have to manage the sessions of each of its users with keeping their connection alive and sending them the correct information. 
 
### mail server

A mail server is a computer that is set up to receive emails and have an account / many accounts set up with it. This is used for when you don't want to or cant use an online mail service like hotmail or gmail. This mail server will primarily be used for the storage and retrieval of emails but can also be setup for the use of internal / private accounts for example at an organisation. This is because when you own a business and therefor a website for that company and so you can set an email server up for you organisation so that you can have internal private emails like Jack.johnson@mywebsite.com rather than Jack.johnson@hotmail.com. In addition to this you van set up very specific rules about who can email who and so on that you would not be able to do otherwise. Finally, because you are running the server by yourself you can ensure that you only allow internal email addresses and to you can cut out all emails from the rest of the internet that could be spam and not useful at all to you. 
 
### proxy server

The final type of server that I will be writing about is proxy servers. These are a special server that is not used for processing but is instead used to redirect traffic through the internet. The best way to think about this is instead of accessing the server you want to directly, you instead access it by first going through the proxy server and then to the server that you want to access. In this image below, you can see what I mean by this:

![Proxy Server](http://cdn.whatismyipaddress.com/images-v4/proxy-server.png)

In this image, you can see a comparison between the two different methods of using and not using a proxy server. When not using a proxy the process is as you would expect, you connect to the server you want and it gets your ip address to know where to send the information to, from this the server can get some information about you like your location and to on. Additionally, if the router / network that you are using blocks you from accessing the server then you will not be able to access it as it blocks you as soon as it sees the connection to that server. On the other hand, if you are using a proxy server then all your information will go through the proxy server rather that your device. This will then mean that the server you are trying to access will get the proxy servers ip address, not your one. This will mean that the server you want to access will have to get information from the proxy servers ip rather than your device, this then means that the server could think that you are from a different country if you and your proxy are in different places. In addition to this, if the network that you are on blocks access to the server that you want then when you use a proxy the network won't block you as you are not blocked from the proxy server so it will go through fine with no problems and you can access the server you want to. 
 
### browser

In order to actually access content that is provided on the world wide web, you need to be able to browse with the internet and as such you will need software installed on your computer that can actually do that, and this is what is called a web browser. The main function of this software is to concert the HTML code that websites are created and programmed in and turn that into an actual nice looking interface like the programmers intended it to look like. HTML is what is called a markup language, this is because instead of programming  logic and reason into the code it is designed to logically layout elements on a screen and that is in the name of HTML as Hyper Text Markup Language .Although that is the main function of the browser, they will have may additional features from managing websites, to plugins to playing different video files and so on. Some examples of popular browsers would be Firebox (made by Mozilla), Chrome (made by Google) and Edge (made by Microsoft). 
 
### email

One of the main methods of communication that is used with in the world wide web and the internet is email. This is the process where you send messages to people via a website name that they have an account associated with, when you send an email to Recipient@website.com the email will get to them as it is forwarded through certain ports and routing. At the other end there will be a mail program that will capture that email you sent and will then allow the person you sent it to. All of this goes through different ports on the internet depending on what the information being sent is. 
### TCP/IP 
TCP/IP is the current language and protocol that is used for the sending and receiving of information on modern networks with modern machines. It contains the rules and information about how information is to be packed, transported and received along with how the message needs to be responded to and networks layout out. The way that the information is sent is through through the technique of cutting splitting the information into smaller parts called packets that are then sent individually across the internet. This means that all the packets could take a different path through the internet and different routers to get to their destination, when they eventually reach the other side they art then reassembled into the correct order and put back to the original file / information. This is then the format / standard for how all information is to be transmitted through the internet and this is the basic way that all modern  information is transmitted. 
 
### Application layer e.g HTTP, MTP

the application layer is a layer in the TCP/IP model and it is responsible for the protocols and interface that the any TCP/IP network uses, this is also included in the OSI network model but it is called the session layer but it does a similar function. When I say that it deals with the protocols and interface I mean that in an TCP/IP network the application layer contains the way that the information is transferred and managed by process to process communication as it defines the standard that the information must use. However, when used as part of the OSI standard, the term application layer is used as the user interface for actually looking as and viewing the information that has been received. The actual protocols that are used as past of the application layer are too long to count, but they are basically the protocols that are high level and are the more interactive ones that get the user interaction. Some examples of this would be:

 * http (webpages)
 * ssh (secure shell access to a server)
 * ftp (file transfer protocol)
 * pop (mail server)
 * dns (domain name server)
 * and so on...

As you can see, all of these are used by processes to other processes and because they are so high level some of these should be recognisable. 
 
### Flow Diagram

In this subsection I will be showing a few diagrams that help explain how the internet actually works and how the information actually goes from the application you are using, down to the signals on the wire ant now it is then sent to another machine and how that machine gets the information again. In the diagram below you can see how both the packets are made as well as how the packets are sent:

![TCP/IF diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/IP_stack_connections.svg/350px-IP_stack_connections.svg.png)

As you can see, the image above shows how the packets make it through the internet as well as how the packets are actually put into packets through the network stack.

The first section of this image is easy to explain so I will start off with that. As explained previously, the way that information is actually sent is through the use of packets. A packet is just where the information that needs to be sent has been split up into very small parts that are only a few kilobytes in size. This is done so that if some of the information does not make it to the other side then the program can still carry on. This then works well with another fact about how packets work, and that is that all the packets are sent individually through the internet, not all as one massive group. This is good for many, many reasons but a few would be that all of the information does not have to be available at once and so it can be sent as a continuous stream and as you can imagine this can open up many possibilities like multilayer games and livestreams. However due to the fact that the information is being split up like this, some of the information might not make it and some of the information might not be in the correct order like it was when it was sent, due to both of these the program that is receiving the information will have to be able to handle these imperfections with the information, but this is fine as the standard for how the information should be sent though packets insures that all of the packets are numbered so that they can be re-ordered. In the first part of the diagram above you can see how in order for the packet to get to the other computer via the internet it will have to travel through routers to get through, and this is the same for all packets and so if there is another way to get to the destination using the routers then the packets could take a different route and arrive at different times. 

In the second part of the image you can see how the actual information will travel through the different parts of the TCP/IP stack that is inside your computer to actually get to the other computer where it then goes back up the stack but in reverse so that it is put back into actual information. I will not be going though how all of these layers actually work because that will require another assignment in itself, but basically each stage will get the information further down to a state where it can be transmitted as actual signals along the wire. In addition to this, the second stage that you see between the LAN and the internet are processes that are performed by the router that connects your private network to the internet. 

this is the process that is required to get the information that you want from a serves to your screen. The process goes as follows:

 * you request information from a server by clicking a web in the web browser that you are using. 
 * the information goes through the TCP/IP stack that is built into your computer and gets put into actual signals on the Ethernet wire. 
 * the packets then go to a domain name server so that they can get an ip address to the name of the website.
 * the packets that you sent make their way to you ISP (Internet Service Provider) and they then send those packets to the world wide web.
 * the packets that you sent find there way to the web hosting provider for the website.
 * the packets are then received by the web server and this processes your request and gives you a session. 
 * it then send back the information from the correct part of the domain structure that website has.


## P2 - Explain the user side and server side factors that influence the performance of a website

In this section I will go through the different factors that influence the performance of a website for both the server and the client as well as how these factors can be negated as much as possible. 

### server side factors

When connecting to a web server, there are many different things that will effect the performance and a few of these factors will be due to the server rather than the user. A few examples of these factors that I will explain are:

 * Web server capacities
 * available bandwidth
 * number of hits
 * file types

#### Web Server capabilities

One main factor that is easy to think of if a website if performing badly is the power of the hardware that the web server is running on. Obviously, if the web server is running on a very old server then the performance of the website will not be good as the hardware cannot keep up with the requests that are being made. However, the hardware that the server is running on will need to be suitable for the website that the web server is actually running. For example if you are hosting a small website that you made then it would run fine on an old computer in your room or a desktop. In this case it would be far too much to get multiple servers set up. On the other hand, if you are hosting a really large website like Google, then a few servers would be no where near enough as you would need thousands of servers to run the website. In conclusion, you a web server should always use the right amount of hardware for the website that it is hosting with more powerful hardware producing a better experience but past a certain point is will become cost ineffective. This would then create a website that will be very slow and will spend a lot of time loading for the customers. 

#### Available bandwidth

Another factor that effects the web server and its ability to give high performance is the amount of bandwidth that it has access to and how much of this is being used. The bandwidth is the amount of information that it can send / receive at the same time, if you think of the internet access a computer has as a hose then the bandwidth is the diameter of the hose, and as it is increased the computer can send and receive more information at the same time. This will only be a problem if there is not enough bandwidth available to the server as it would not be able to serve all of its customers the information that they require and the will effect the performance greatly. If there is not enough bandwidth available then the server will have to buffer the information that it wants to send and this will mean that the users of the website will have to wait a long time to get the information that they want and this would create a bad user experience as the website would be laggy and non-responsive. 

#### Number of hits

to start off with, the number of hits that a website gets is just the number of people that visit the website, this can be used to measure how popular a website is as with more hits the website will have more people visiting it and will be more popular. The problem with getting a large number of hits is that the bandwidth the server has access to will be filled up, and in addition to this the server will have to keep track of many sessions and this could overload the server and cause the server to crash or it could cause the server to not accept any new connections. of course, this is not very likely to happen, but if it does then it could be catastrophic. To ensure that this does not happen you should ensure that you have the correct number of servers set up for your website so that if one gets too busy then you can offload some of the work to another server that you have so that the website remains usable. If this were to happen to a website that you are using then you would know as the website would get slower and slower until the website would crash or stop all information from accessing it and effectively kick you off.  

#### file types

A final factor that I will go through that is not very often thought of are the file types that the server uses and the size of them as well as the ease of use that they have. The main factor here is the size of the files that the server is using and sending. For example, if you had a website that would play small audio clips that are not of the highest quality then you would want the audio to be stored as a small file size like a compressed mp3 rather than something like a lossless flac file that is normally used for high end audio and will normally be tens to hundreds of times the size. If the website chose to use just the flac files then they would take a lot longer to download on the users machine and would provide no benefit for the download cost. Another reason is that if the server uses files that are hard to work with and take a while to write to then it will also be slow. In the end if the sever uses the incorrect file types then the loading of the website can take a while and this could put some customers off the website. 

### User side factors

when measuring the performance of a web server you need to consider the user side factors just as much as the server side factors to that you get a fair assessment, below I will go through a few of these factors:

 * download speed
 * PC performance
 	* browser
	* cache
	* processor

#### Download speed

The main factor that will influence the perceived speed of a web page for a user would be the download speed that they have. This is a measure of how quickly the users machine will be able to download files and this is measured in the number of megabits that the computer cat download per second, for reference a very good measure would be 100 mbps. This then means that with a higher download speed the user would be able to download the content from the website faster and would have a better experience. On the other hand, if the user has a bad download speed then they would not be able to access the website's content fast at all and this would result in the user having a bad experience. Although this cannot be solved completely, the server should look to ensure that all the content that it wants to send is  as small as it can get whilst still having the website look and behave as intended. 

#### PC performance

The computer that the user is running will effect the performance that they will get from the website, and there are a few main things that will effect this and those are the browser, cache and processor. The browser is the past that will actually convert the code that the developers created into how they wanted it to look, with a more modern browser the conversion will be quicker as there are new ways to convert the code created. In addition to this, a newer browser will enable new website technologies to run that can be used to create better websites. Next there is the cache, this is a part of the browser that stores parts of websites that you have visited so that you don't have to re-download that past again. With cache this will improve the user experience as the download when visiting a website again will be less and so it will load faster and give better performance. Finally, there is the actual processor or CPU of the computer, and this will have the largest impact as with a better processor the user will be able to convert the website faster as well as be able to convert many more things at once and this will lead to a faster experience by a large amount.

## P3 - Explain the security risks and protection mechanisms involved in website performance

In this section I will be going through different security risks and protections that are involved with websites, and specifically how they will effect the performance of the website. For this I will be going through the risks that a website could face as well as how they could protect themselves in the order shown below:

 *  Security risk
 	* hacking
	* virus
	* identity theft
 *  protection mechanisms 
 	* firewall
 	* secure socket layers
 	* Strong passwords

### Security risks

When you host a website you are basically putting out to the internet a way to access you server, while this is good as it means that people can access the content that you want them to, some people will take this a different way and they will attempt to hack into your system and then exploit it for their own personal gain and as such you first need to know what is is that they can do. 

#### Hacking

The main way that people will initially get into your system is through the use of hacking your web server, now while the term 'hacking' can mean many things the general meaning is where someone gains access to a system without prior permission from the owner. In most cases this is done through the use of exploits in software that will generate an unwanted outcome but hacking can happen in many ways. The main reason that hacking is so common is due to the fact that it can be done from across the world and still have the same effect as anywhere else, this then opens up the option of hacking to anyone that can access your website. However, as strange as it may sound the hacking it not the real problem, the real problem is what the hackers can do to your system after they have got into it and that is what the next points are about. 

#### Virus

After your server has been hacked, one of the worst things that the hacker can do is to install a virus in your system. In this case the virus is a piece of software that will run in the background of your server and can be nearly invisible and can do anything that the hacker wants it to do. One main virus that is installed will collect information from the system that people input and then send that information directly to the hacker, this information can be many things but the main target would have to be the credential information of the customers, so their username and password. In addition to this the virus could also redirect the customers of the website to another one that will try to get their details that way. When the hacker has access to credential information then they can then perform identity theft...

#### Identity theft

One of the main things that any hacker would do once they have credential information is that they would perform identity theft with that information. The premiss of identity theft is very simple as what the hacker does is they gain access to an account that they do not own and they pretend to be that person, with this they can then make purchases for themselves with this account so that they make money. This is of course illegal but it is done a lot as is is quite difficult to trace who did what and how it happened. This tends to work as most people have the same passwords for many different websites and to when you have access to one you have access to another.    

### Protection mechanisms

Of course it is not all bad news as there are many, many different ways that you can protect yourself from these attacks so that they will basically never happen and so that you are safe. Below, I will go through three main ways that you can both protect yourself on-line as well if you host a server 

#### Firewall

This one only really applies to the people who host a server, however this information can still be useful to anyone just browsing on-line. A firewall is basically a specialised computer that sits between your main computer and the internet, its analyse each packet that enters your network and decide if it should be allowed in based on how you program it. For example, you might host a web server and decide that if the same person makes 10 connections per second for 10 seconds then they will be blocked to your website for 48 hours as they had to be malicious and not a real person as they would not have made that many connections otherwise. This is good as it means that all of the processing for the packets will not block up the main server and so all legitimate users will be able to use the website with no performance downsides while all non-legitimate users will not have access. 

#### Secure socket layer

A protection that is more for the users of a website is that they should use Secure Socket Layer (SSL), put very simply this will ensure that all communication between you and the server is encrypted so that only you and the server actually know what each other are saying. SSL is a good thing to have as otherwise you could be liable to a man=in-the-middle attack and all your information stolen, the way that this works is that someone will sit between you and the server and read all of the information that you share with each other. Without SSL in this example the man in the middle might be able to literally see "password = PaSsW0Rd232" in the messages that you send, but with SSL they would only be able to see "aroslcjv236>jstrseh2" and therefore not get any information from you. 

#### Strong passwords

A protection that this time is for both the user and the web hoster that may seem very simple is that you should have a strong password for all of your accounts and that they should be different for all websites to make it better. But why is it that you should have a strong password? its so that no one can break into your account. For example, lets say that you have a password like "1234567890" and someone wanted to gain access to your account. If they just tried random combinations thee they would most likely get into your account quickly and who knows what they could do from there. Now, lets assume that you are a bit smarter and you have a password like "Password1234567890", now you may think that this is good because you have a capital letter, and numbers and its REALLY long. But then the person getting into your account has a program that will put words and numbers together in order to break passwords and they would have access to your account in minutes. As you can see, with a not strong password your account will be hacked very quickly so that is why you need a strong password that exceeds the recommended level on websites.  

#### data protection

Finally, everyone who stores data or information is protected by the data protection act and in is as follows: 

>  The Data Protection Act controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government.
> 
> Everyone responsible for using data has to follow strict rules called âdata protection principlesâ. They must make sure the information is:
> 
> * used fairly and lawfully
> * used for limited, specifically stated purposes
> * used in a way that is adequate, relevant and not excessive
> * accurate
> * kept for no longer than is absolutely necessary
> * handled according to peopleâs data protection rights
> * kept safe and secure
> * not transferred outside the European Economic Area without adequate protection
>  
>  There is stronger legal protection for more sensitive information, such as:
>  
> * ethnic background
> * political opinions
> * religious beliefs
> * health
> * sexual health
> * criminal records

This means that if the data protection act is ever broken then the person who broke it is breaking the law. This will mainly apply to if you are hosting a website and if you are then you will need to follow this otherwise you could get into a lot of trouble and your website could get shut down.  

## M1 - Explain the role of web architecture in website communications

In this section I will go through how the role that that web architecture has had in the role of website communication. To start off with I will explain what websites used to be like back when they where new and there was no website communication and then I will go on to explain what types of websites came from the addition of the web architecture components mentioned above. 

 * original websites
 * Web 2.0 
 * blogs
 * cloud computing
 * on-line applications

Back when website were a new thing and the early stages of the internet had only just been invented websites were very, very basic and only had the ability to display text on a screen from a remote location. At the time this was revolutionary as you could get information onto your computer from all the way across the country, however that is nothing compared to anything at all today. This was good for a while as you could send basic messages to people, but that was about it. At this stage the communication between websites and their users was very poor and due to this there was a need for something more and this something more was known as Web 2.0

### Web 2.0

web 2.0 was the name that was given to the trend that moved websites away from being static pages that only the owner could change to websites where anyone's input would change the web page for everyone else to see. An example of this would be comparing an on-line help guide for software where there are no comments (a web page that you can only read and only the owner can change) to a blog where people can write down what they want and the viewers can comment on the page and like and dislike things (a web page that you can interact with and anyone can change. This was a huge change for the web as it allowed far more types of websites to flourish and changed the internet from a resource that  a few people used to a huge communication hub that all people could use to communicate with each other. Due to this increased usage and viability that the internet gained there was now a need for a more robust and structured infrastructure so that it could support all the many more people that where now using it, and this infrastructure is what I have mentioned previously in this assignment as they all helped really connect the internet and make it work. Due to this web 2.0 there were many different types of websites that could be created and that would flourish with users and I will now to through to explain a few of those.  

#### Blogs

one of the first types of websites that was created after the web 2.0 were blogs, blogs where a type of website that people could use to write down what they want and it would be on their own part of the internet. These websites were very simple and would often not have  very many options for web page formatting like modern HTML but it was a brand new concept. With this new type of web page, the users of the website could change the content of the web page and they didn't have to own it, due to this social circles grew around communities that used these blogs and as such the internet took its first steps to the social hub that it is today. The way that blogs work is that the users of a blog could create an account with the website and this would allow all of their posts to be shown as by the same person, after they had created an account the users could then make a post about basically anything they wanted and then everyone who navigated to that page would be able to see that post. If that visitor then had an account they could then make a reply to the posts an on-line discussion. The term blog came from the word log as people would make logs of what they did on these web pages. 

#### Cloud computing 

after web 2.0 had been out for a very long time there was a system set up where there would be some sort of powerful server set-up that would be running the web page and then the users of the web page would then connect with their desktops to access the site, however after a while people started wanting to have the really powerful servers that where running the web page to also be able to do more things like process information and store files remotely and from this cloud computing was made. Before cloud computing there was a set-up where people would use servers for storing files using FTP (file transfer protocol) and for processing and remote access with SSH (secure shell protocol) but theses two different protocols where not joined and they were a bit clunky and bot usable for the main users of the internet. Then cloud computing was created and this unified the storage and processing of information on servers a lot easier as it was combined into one and then hosted by different companies. This was another step further than the simple web pages of blogs as the users could now upload files and have the servers do commands rather than just writing words on a web page and this was ten a huge success especially by companies. This is mainly used by companies as it would cost a lot less to 'rent' a server with cloud computing than it would be to buy one outright. 

#### On-line applications

One example of where the use of web 2.0 has come in really handy and has work well is through the use of on-line applications for jobs and other services. This works well as rather than actually having a piece of paper to the job that you are trying to apply to you just need to go on-line and upload your CV instead. This is goods for the applicant as it means that they do not have to actually hand in a physical piece of paper to the organisation so they will save on a day out for that. In addition to this it will also help them see more places that are looking for applicants as you don't have to knows the actual company and you can just do it all on-line. On the other side this is also good for the organisation as now they will have digital copies of all the applicants information and this will mean that they will always have a backup of this information in case something happens and that it is good. In addition to this, they will be able to much easier share the information to the people who need it through email and such.  

## D1 - Explain the role of the TCP/IP protocol and how it links to application layer protocols

It this final section I will be going through the TCP / IP model and how this links to the protocols that are in the application layer and how this actually relates to the internet and how is works.

### TCP/IP model

The TCP/IP model is a set of protocols and layers that govern and control how communication is to happen on a network that uses TCP/IP to work. The model is made up of 4 different layers that each have a certain function and process to do with the information that needs to be sent on a network. I will now go through a basic explanation of the layers and what they do and I will then go through a more in depth explanation of the application layer. 

#### Layer 1 - network access layer

The network access layer is the lowest layer that there is in the TCP/IP model and as such this is the closest one to the actual signals that are on the wire. Due to this the network access layer deals with how to send the physical spinals across the wire and so it deals with the actual wires in the cable that the signals will be sent on and how much voltage they will have as well. In addition to this it will also handle the sending of information if the network is connected via an optical cable and so on. due to this there are not really any protocols that are in place that could be easily explained. 

#### Layer 2 - Internet layer

The internet layer is the layer that is responsible for packing up all the information that needs to be sent to the network into packets of data to that it can actually travel in the network. This works by putting the information into packets that are called IP diagrams, this is done to ensure that all the information that is needed is placed in the packet like the destination, sender, ip address and so on. In addition to this, the internet layer is also responsible  for the initial routing of the packets so that they will initially know where to go. The protocols that are used here are the very low level ones like IP and ARP.

#### Layer 3 - Transport Layer 

The transport layer is the second to top layer and it is used to keep the connection between two connected devices alive and ensure that the connection goes on as long as it needs to without one side terminating and the other end to not know. The way that this works is that every so often each computer will ask the other computer if the connection is still alive and if it is then the connection can carry on. In addition to this, the transport layer defines the level of service and the status of the connection that is used in that certain connection and so it will know what the connection is and there for how to manage it. The name of the protocols that are in this layer are the more basic but frequently used protocols like TCP and UDP. 

#### Layer 4 - Application layer

The final layer that there is in the TCP/IP model is the application layer and this is the layer that is the closest to the person who is actually using the computer and as such these are the most commonly used protocols. The main function that this layer has is that it will get the information that is to be sent from the software to the rest of the network stack and as such it will be ready to be sent. It provides the protocols that applications will use to actually to interface with the Transport layer, Due to its close use with applications this layer contains the most well known of the protocols that people will be familiar with. Due to the nature that these packets have and because they are such a high level they will tend to layout and show how the information is to be laid out for that command and how it is expected to be received.  A few of the main protocols that are applicable to the application layer are:

 * HTTP
 * SSH
 * FTP
 * and many more...

As you can see, the TCP/IP protocol is a suite of protocols that dictate and handle the communication of information of information on a TCP/IP network. They range from the low level protocols that dictate the actual signals that go on the wire all the way up to the protocols that dictate how the information that you want will be packaged up into individual packets and how this will be arranged. From this you can see that the application layer is just a layer that is used in the initial stages and dictates the layout of information to be sent. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion you can see that I have demonstrated that I know how the web works as well as how all the components that make up the web fit together and what they all do. Furthermore, I have also shown that I have the ability to assess the factors that can affect the performance of a web server from both the user side and the side of the web server side as well as what can be done to fix these. Finally I have shown how major changes in the internet have affected the use of the internet and the fundamentals behind how the protocols work.
