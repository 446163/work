## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through how the internet and websites actually work with all the tools and how all of the different parts are actually connected and what part they serve. In addition to this I will also be going through the different security that is in place for you and the website as well as how the performance of the website is actually effected by the users and the host of the content. 


P1 - Outline the web architecture and components which enable internet and web functionality

In this section I will be going through the different components that are available and that actually help you to get information from a server on-line. The components that I will be going through are as follows:

 * Internet service provider
 * Web hosing services
 * domain structure
 * domain name registrar
 * World wide web
 * web server
 * mail server
 * proxy server
 * browser
 * email
 * TCP/IP
 * Application layer e.g HTTP, MTP
 * Flow Diagram

## Internet service provider

When connection to the internet, your internet service provider (ISP) is the company who is actually responsible for connecting you to the internet and the rest of the computers that are connect to it. They do this by having lines in the ground that actually connect all of the computers that they serve so that they have a massive network of computers that are all connected together, and that is basically the internet. However, these companies also link into all the other companies that are ISP'S as well so that they can connect all of the computers on this massive network that we call the internet. The reasons that you could not just set up your own ISP easily is because of the infrastructure that is require and is in place like all the cables, control centres, servers and so on... Some examples of these companies would be BT ,Sky, Virgin media and so on.  
 
## Web hosing services

A web hosting service is a service that actually hosts and servers the customers to the website that you create. It may help to think of them as the physical store to a product that you have created. They will provide the hardware and access to the item (website) but you will hive to supply them with the item in the first place. They will manage the upkeep of the actual store and the ability that customers have to access it. However, they will require a fee from the you to actually keep the limited shelf storage filled with your item. This means that the web hosting service will provide you with a server that they own to run the website that you have created, due to this they will be supplying the server hardware to run it as well as the internet connection that is used to access the site that you have created. It is also up to them to ensure that the server your website is running on is actually fit for purpose and not in a condition where it cooed fail, likewise the same must be considered for the internet connection. Some examples of name brands would be 1&1, 123.reg and godaddy. 
 
## domain structure

The domain structure is the way that the website actually organises the sub websites and the parts of the website in a way that they can all be accessed under the same website name. A main example of this would be 
 
## domain name registrar
 
## World wide web
 
## web server
 
## mail server
 
## proxy server
 
## browser
 
## email
 
## TCP/IP
 
## Application layer e.g HTTP, MTP
