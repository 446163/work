## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through how the internet and websites actually work with all the tools and how all of the different parts are actually connected and what part they serve. In addition to this I will also be going through the different security that is in place for you and the website as well as how the performance of the website is actually effected by the users and the host of the content. 


P1 - Outline the web architecture and components which enable internet and web functionality

In this section I will be going through the different components that are available and that actually help you to get information from a server on-line. The components that I will be going through are as follows:

 * Internet service provider
 * Web hosing services
 * domain structure
 * domain name registrar
 * World wide web
 * web server
 * mail server
 * proxy server
 * browser
 * email
 * TCP/IP
 * Application layer e.g HTTP, MTP
 * Flow Diagram

## Internet service provider

When connection to the internet, your internet service provider (ISP) is the company who is actually responsible for connecting you to the internet and the rest of the computers that are connect to it. They do this by having lines in the ground that actually connect all of the computers that they serve so that they have a massive network of computers that are all connected together, and that is basically the internet. However, these companies also link into all the other companies that are ISP'S as well so that they can connect all of the computers on this massive network that we call the internet. The reasons that you could not just set up your own ISP easily is because of the infrastructure that is require and is in place like all the cables, control centres, servers and so on.. test
