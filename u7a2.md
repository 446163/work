## Introduction 

In this assignment I will be going through how you can keep a network secure and ensure that the data that is on the system stays secure and that the data inside does not get leaked. This will be in the form of a presentation and as such there will be no content in this document but all of the work will be attached at the end of the document in presentation format. In addition to this I will be doing this for the aerospace industry and as such these presentations will be based on these. 

P2 - Describe how physical security measures can help keep systems secure
 
### Introduction

One main way to protect your system and the information on it, is to ensure that the systems and the servers are protected from physical attacks and that they are physically difficult to reach.  

The main ways that you can use to protect your systems physically can be stored down to a few base measures:

* Keening the server in a locked room
* restricting access to the server
* have security systems for the server room 
and...
* encrypting the data just in case

### Looking the server in a room 

The main way that the server can be kept physically secure is by keeping the server in a secure area like a heavily locked room. This can either be in the airport itself, off site, or even hosted at a data centre.  

#### On site

If you keep the server on site then you will need to ensure that it is in a very secure place and that it is out of the way of people using the airport may be inclined to get into the server room if they are that way inclined and it would be really easy for them if the room is out in the open. Furthermore if the server room is hosted in site then  the airport would need to pay for the room and its requirements. 

#### Offside

Instead of hosting the server on site at the airport you might be included to host the server off site in another facility that you own. This in most cases would be better than having the server in the actual airport because when the server is held off site then there is less chance that the server would be used illegally as less people would have access to it. However it also means that they may be some latency with using the system and this could mean that the system seems slow to users. Finally, you would also have to make sure that the room it is in is very secured as well even off site. 

#### Data centre

The final option here is that you could always just have the server stored at an off site data centre and have a company look after the server for you. This can be good as it will mean that the server is definitely secure due to the fact that that is the only reason the company that you are using will have business. However, this will mean that you will have to pay them for as long as they use your servers and this in the long run could add up to more and you could have saved money by hosting it yourself. 

### restricting access to the system 

One of the main ways that you can keep a server physically secure once it is in place is by only allowing certain people to access the server and the server room. This would then mean that only people who are allows to be with the server are and if you chose your employees correctly this would mean that you will have no data thefts at all. The main way for this would be to have all staff working in the facility to have a card with them that will allow them to open certain doors. 

#### Staff access cards

With giving staff that will work around the system security cards that have there account on it you can restrict access to the server to only people who you want to have accessing the server and as such you can only allow people who need to use the server access for the time that they need to use it. 

### server security 

With having a server you will also want to ensure that the server has certain security for the room that it is in so that in case it is broken into you would know about it. Some ways of doing this would be to have:
	
* alarms
* security cameras

Now these are not supposed to stop the intruder but let you know that they are there or to scare them off. And as such leave the server untouched and the information on it safe. 

#### alarms

Alarms will help you as they will sound when the intruder is detected and as such this will scare them off as they know that they will be detected.and found if they do not escape. These will also mean that people will be deterred from the servers as they will see the alarms and not want to break in so it was a double effect. 

### Security cameras 

With these installed you would be able to see anyone who break-in to the server room using the security cameras, this will also help with identifying who it was that broke into the server room as you would be able to see distinguishing features about them that you could not get otherwise. Finally they will also act as a deterrent and keep people from breaking into the server room. 

### Finally....encryption

When you are storing information on a server that could be accessed by anyone then you will need to make sure that the information is encrypted so that if any of the hard droves are stolen then the data is secure and cannot be read.   

### further information 

Finally, for all of these different section the same can be said about other companies due to the fact that they will have the same precautions and threats to their data. 

## P2 - Describe how software and network security can keep systems and data secure. 

### Introduction

In the following slides I will be describing and explaining how you can use software and networking to keep the data on you servers secure. This will go over the following points:
	
* Encryption
	* communication
	* storage 
* intranet 
* separate systems 
* passwords / accounts
* Firewall


### Communication encryption

For this these can be many different ways that they can be done but the main ways would have to be RSA Public / private key encryption and https in some cases. 

### RSA

RSA encryption is used when communicating between servers and works with a public encryption keys that everyone can know and a private key that only the server itself knows about. This can be used so that if someone is listening to the communication between two of the devices on the network then they would not be able to actually get any of the information that are are sending to each other and as such the data will stay secure. This can easily be incorporated between any of the servers / machines.  

### Storage 

When storing data as mentioned in the previous section you should always to bes sure to keep that information secure and encrypted so that if a hard drive is stolen then then data cannot be read. This can be very important but it is very easy to set up and use as there are many programs available and the work on the CPU is not too much when you are decrypting it. A good example of software for this would be bitlocker as it is freely available and very secure.  

### Intranet

An intranet is a network of computers that it external to the actual internet and instead act on their own accord and are  used mainly for business use. It is a good idea to have one of these as it means that the information going around the network cannot be access by someone who is not on the network and as such it will be protected heavily. This can also be used to speed up communications as there would be less traffic in the way of the information. 

### Separate systems

Another way to reduce the probability of getting information stolen would be to have the information go through separate systems that all have their distinct jobs. This would mean that seat booking on the flights would go through a small closed off system that would make it hard for the information to be intercepted. This will also mean that there would be less traffic that contains raw data going around the system and this would be generally more secure. Finally it would also allow for easier setup and structure as all of the systems would be distinct and data would be less likely to get lost along the way. 

### Passwords / Accounts

With the addition f user accounts and permission levels among the systems this would have the effect that people would only be allowed to access the files and settings that they need. This would mean that the information of the server that is very critical and secretive cannot be access by anyone on the system and only by the people who would need to access it. This would therefore make hacking the system harder as you would have to have access to a high up account and not just a typical employee and the high up people would have far stringer passwords. 

### Firewall

The final type of software security that you could have on a system like for an airline would be a firewall as this would block all types of packets that are not allowed in the network and this would be good for the network that an airline company would have as it could block the packets from someone who is try to steal the information automatically without intervention from a person.  

## M2 - Explain the operation and use of an encryption technique in ensuring security of transmitted information

In this section I will be going through 3 different encryption techniques and how they are  actually used and how they work when transmitting information. For this I will be using 3 examples:

* Symmetric encryption 
* Asymmetric encryption 
* Hashing

But before we start on these its best to know the actual term I will be using within these explanations and these will be:

* keys
* modulo

### Keys

When actually encryption a message or some information the encryption will use keys as a way to prove identity and who can access the information. A key is basically a series of information that is used as the main way to encrypt the information. The information that is then to be encrypted is then passed through a function with this key value as the main operator. This will then mean that with they key you can do the process in reverse and have a unencrypted message. 

### Modulo

Modulo is just a simple mathematical function that returns the remainder when the two numbers that are divided. For example 8 and 3, 3 divides into 8 2 times with a remainder of 2 and as such this answer for modulo is 2. This process is used a lot within encryption due to the fact that it is very one way method and you cannot take 2 and easily guess 8 and 3 from that, this is how messages can be easily encrypted but not easily decrypted. 

### Symmetrical encryption

This method of encryption is the most simple method and this is where the information to be encrypted is passed through the modulo function and its a bit more complex but that is basically it This will then produce a system where there is 1 key for the information to be unencrypted. This would then be similar to a computer system where the information on the computer is encrypted by the user login and as such there is only one way to an encrypt the information. 


### Asymmetrical encryption

In contrast to symmetrical encryption there is asymmetrical encryption. This is far more complicated and uses highly advanced mathematical functions, but it is basically the same as the other option but in this case there are two different keys produced in such a way that they are linked mathematically so that one cannot be guessed from the other. In addition to this the keys are also linked so that only one can be used to encrypt the information and only the other can be used to encrypt the information. This is called public and private key encryption because one key al always help by just the user while the other is shown to everyone to encrypt messages to them. 

### Hashing

Although this is not technically an encryption technique this is used for when you are getting information and checking it is the correctly entered information. The basic process is the information be checked is passed through a one way system like the modulo function, this will then be compared to the other encrypted outputs and if it is the same then the information will be allowed through and the information will be correct.  

## D1 - discuss different ways from recovering from a disaster 

In this section I will be going through the different ways that companies can recover from a disaster and how they can recover from it. A disaster can happen in many ways but in general it would mean that some data that is needed on the system has been removed from that the system is and this would need to be recovered or the company could face some serious problems. This can happen in many ways and as such it can take quite a lot to actually protect your self from these different things so you would want to come up with a recover method so that you can fix the system if it does go wrong. 

### Techniques

A few of the techniques that can be used to recover a system are as follows+

* Backups
	* full
	* Incremental 
* Imaging
* System restore point

### Backups 

The first thing on this list would have to be the backups that you want for the system. A backup is a copy of the system that can be restored from the copy hard drive whenever the system requires it. These can also be done in two main ways and these are:

* Full backup 
* Incremental backup

### Full backups

A full backup of a system is exactly what it sounds like and it is a backup of everything on a system from all areas of storage. This is done when you want to fully restore the whole system after any event happens. This will mean that you could use this full restore to completely put a 1 to 12 copy of the server on a another system that has the same hardware. This is good as it means that you can restore the system very quickly but it will take a while to back up the system ad require a large amount of space that is basically the same as the system that is in place. 

### Incremental backups

The alternate form of backing up data is an incremental backup and these can happen in a few ways but the principle is the same. Basically you would want to backup only the things that have changes in the system since you last backed up the system. The advantage of this is that the system will take up less space per backup and that it will be very very quick to backup the changes. However the disadvantages of this would be that it would take a while to apply the backups back on to the system as it would have to load up the last full restore and then all of the incremental backups on top of that. 

### Comparison

From this you can see that the full system backups are great as they allow for the whole system to be backed up but the process will take quite a while and a lot of system resources. On the other hand the use of incremental backups have only the changes in the system backed up so that it is very quick and easy on the system but when the system would need to be restored then it will take a while as it would need to restore all of the backups on top of each other. Due to this the best course of action would be to make full system backups rarely but on a regular basis and then making the incremental system backups on a very regular occasion. 

### comparison cont..

This would therefore have the affect that you will have the system being backed up very frequently and in these cases it would be very quickly. In addition to this at scheduled times you should also have a full system backup done so that the system can be backed up quickly overall while not using all of the system resources. 

### Imaging

A system image is like a back up of the system that can be installed on all of the machine within a system and it contains all of the software and settings for the machine to be on the network. These can be used when the system or a user on the system needs to make their machine useable. Although these are not used for saving data they can be used to restore the system and get it up and running. These are also used with PXE boot servers to deploy the image.  

### System restore point

A system restore point is basically a form of a backup that is compressed and stored on the machine that it is backing up from. These can very easily be run in the background every now and then and back up all of the information a system and then compress the data stored on the system. These are good as they are very very easy to perform and actually do due to the fact that the information is on the system compressed, but this also means that if the system goes completely down then the information will be lost. 

## Conclusion

Overall you can see that the through this assignment I have shown that I know the information about security especially through the use of software and networking. In addition to this I have also shown that I have the ability to show this for the company use of an airline whilst also looking out for other companies.
