## Introduction 

In this assignment I will be going through how you can keep a network secure and ensure that the data that is on the system stays secure and that the data inside does not get leaked. This will be in the form of a presentation and as such there will be no content in this document but all of the work will be attached at the end of the document in presentation format. In addition to this I will be doing this for the aerospace industry and as such these presentations will be based on these. 

P2 - Describe how physical security measures can help keep systems secure
 
## Introduction

One main way to protect your system and the information on it, is to ensure that the systems and the servers are protected from physical attacks and that they are physically difficult to reach.  

The main ways that you can use to protect your systems physically can be stored down to a few base measures:

	* Keening the server in a locked room
	* restricting access to the server
	* have security systems for the server room 
	and...
	* encrypting the data just in case

### Looking the server in a room 

The main way that the server can be kept physically secure is by keeping the server in a secure area like a heavily locked room. This can either be in the airport itself, off site, or even hosted at a data centre.  

#### On site

If you keep the server on site then you will need to ensure that it is in a very secure place and that it is out of the way of people using the airport may be inclined to get into the server room if they are that way inclined and it would be really easy for them if the room is out in the open. Furthermore if the server room is hosted in site then  the airport would need to pay for the room and its requirements. 

#### Offside

Instead of hosting the server on site at the airport you might be included to host the server off site in another facility that you own. This in most cases would be better than having the server in the actual airport because when the server is held off site then there is less chance that the server would be used illegally as less people would have access to it. However it also means that they may be some latency with using the system and this could mean that the system seems slow to users. Finally, you would also have to make sure that the room it is in is very secured as well even off site. 

#### Data centre

The final option here is that you could always just have the server stored at an off site data centre and have a company look after the server for you. This can be good as it will mean that the server is definitely secure due to the fact that that is the only reason the company that you are using will have business. However, this will mean that you will have to pay them for as long as they use your servers and this in the long run could add up to more and you could have saved money by hosting it yourself. 

### restricting access to the system 

One of the main ways that you can keep a server physically secure once it is in place is by only allowing certain people to access the server and the server room. This would then mean that only people who are allows to be with the server are and if you chose your employees correctly this would mean that you will have no data thefts at all. The main way for this would be to have all staff working in the facility to have a card with them that will allow them to open certain doors. 

#### Staff access cards

With giving staff that will work around the system security cards that have there account on it you can restrict access to the server to only people who you want to have accessing the server and as such you can only allow people who need to use the server access for the time that they need to use it. 

### server security 

With having a server you will also want to ensure that the server has certain security for the room that it is in so that in case it is broken into you would know about it. Some ways of doing this would be to have:
	
	* alarms
	* security cameras
	* infrared sensors 

Now these are not supposed to stop the intruder but let you know that they are there or to scare them off.
