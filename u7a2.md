## Introduction 

In this assignment I will be going through how you can keep a network secure and ensure that the data that is on the system stays secure and that the data inside does not get leaked. This will be in the form of a presentation and as such there will be no content in this document but all of the work will be attached at the end of the document in presentation format. In addition to this I will be doing this for the aerospace industry and as such these presentations will be based on these. 

P2 - Describe how physical security measures can help keep systems secure
 
## Introduction

One main way to protect your system and the information on it, is to ensure that the systems and the servers are protected from physical attacks and that they are physically difficult to reach.  

The main ways that you can use to protect your systems physically can be stored down to a few base measures:

	* Keening the server in a locked room
	* restricting access to the server
	* have security systems for in the server room 
	and...
	* encrypting the data just in case

### Looking the server in a room 

The main way that the server can be kept physically secure is by keeping the server in a secure area like a heavily locked room. This can either be in the airport itself, off site, or even hosted at a data centre.  

#### On site

If you keep the server on site then you will need to ensure that it is in a very secure place and that it is out of the way of people using the airport may be inclined to get into the server room if they are that way inclined and it would be really easy for them if the room is out in the open. Furthermore if the server room is hosted in site then  the airport would need to pay for the room and its requirements. 

#### Offside

Instead of hosting the server on site at the airport you might be included to host the server off site in another facility that you own. This in most cases would be better at
