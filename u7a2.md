## Introduction 

In this assignment I will be going through how you can keep a network secure and ensure that the data that is on the system stays secure and that the data inside does not get leaked. This will be in the form of a presentation and as such there will be no content in this document but all of the work will be attached at the end of the document in presentation format. In addition to this I will be doing this for the aerospace industry and as such these presentations will be based on these. 

P2 - Describe how physical security measures can help keep systems secure
 
### Introduction

One main way to protect your system and the information on it, is to ensure that the systems and the servers are protected from physical attacks and that they are physically difficult to reach.  

The main ways that you can use to protect your systems physically can be stored down to a few base measures:

	* Keening the server in a locked room
	* restricting access to the server
	* have security systems for the server room 
	and...
	* encrypting the data just in case

### Looking the server in a room 

The main way that the server can be kept physically secure is by keeping the server in a secure area like a heavily locked room. This can either be in the airport itself, off site, or even hosted at a data centre.  

#### On site

If you keep the server on site then you will need to ensure that it is in a very secure place and that it is out of the way of people using the airport may be inclined to get into the server room if they are that way inclined and it would be really easy for them if the room is out in the open. Furthermore if the server room is hosted in site then  the airport would need to pay for the room and its requirements. 

#### Offside

Instead of hosting the server on site at the airport you might be included to host the server off site in another facility that you own. This in most cases would be better than having the server in the actual airport because when the server is held off site then there is less chance that the server would be used illegally as less people would have access to it. However it also means that they may be some latency with using the system and this could mean that the system seems slow to users. Finally, you would also have to make sure that the room it is in is very secured as well even off site. 

#### Data centre

The final option here is that you could always just have the server stored at an off site data centre and have a company look after the server for you. This can be good as it will mean that the server is definitely secure due to the fact that that is the only reason the company that you are using will have business. However, this will mean that you will have to pay them for as long as they use your servers and this in the long run could add up to more and you could have saved money by hosting it yourself. 

### restricting access to the system 

One of the main ways that you can keep a server physically secure once it is in place is by only allowing certain people to access the server and the server room. This would then mean that only people who are allows to be with the server are and if you chose your employees correctly this would mean that you will have no data thefts at all. The main way for this would be to have all staff working in the facility to have a card with them that will allow them to open certain doors. 

#### Staff access cards

With giving staff that will work around the system security cards that have there account on it you can restrict access to the server to only people who you want to have accessing the server and as such you can only allow people who need to use the server access for the time that they need to use it. 

### server security 

With having a server you will also want to ensure that the server has certain security for the room that it is in so that in case it is broken into you would know about it. Some ways of doing this would be to have:
	
	* alarms
	* security cameras

Now these are not supposed to stop the intruder but let you know that they are there or to scare them off. And as such leave the server untouched and the information on it safe. 

#### alarms

Alarms will help you as they will sound when the intruder is detected and as such this will scare them off as they know that they will be detected.and found if they do not escape. These will also mean that people will be deterred from the servers as they will see the alarms and not want to break in so it was a double effect. 

### Security cameras 

With these installed you would be able to see anyone who break-in to the server room using the security cameras, this will also help with identifying who it was that broke into the server room as you would be able to see distinguishing features about them that you could not get otherwise. Finally they will also act as a deterrent and keep people from breaking into the server room. 

### Finally....encryption

When you are storing information on a server that could be accessed by anyone then you will need to make sure that the information is encrypted so that if any of the hard droves are stolen then the data is secure and cannot be read.   

### further information 

Finally, for all of these different section the same can be said about other companies due to the fact that they will have the same precautions and threats to their data. 

## P2 - Describe how software and network security can keep systems and data secure. 

### Introduction

In the following slides I will be describing and explaining how you can use software and networking to keep the data on you servers secure. This will go over the following points:
	
	* Encryption
		* communication
		* storage 
	* intranet 
	* separate systems 
	* passwords / accounts
	* Firewall


### Communication encryption

For this these can be many different ways that they can be done but the main ways would have to be RSA Public / private key encryption and https in some cases. 

### RSA

RSA encryption is used when communicating between servers and works with a public encryption keys that everyone can know and a private key that only the server itself knows about. This can be used so that if someone is listening to the communication between two of the devices on the network then they would not be able to actually get any of the information that are are sending to each other and as such the data will stay secure. This can easily be incorporated between any of the servers / machines.  

### Storage 

When storing data as mentioned in the previous section you should always to bes sure to keep that information secure and encrypted so that if a hard drive is stolen then then data cannot be read. This can be very important but it is very easy to set up and use as there are many programs available and the work on the CPU is not too much when you are decrypting it. A good example of software for this would be bitlocker as it is freely available and very secure.  

### Intranet

An intranet is a network of computers that it external to the actual internet and instead act on their own accord and are  used mainly for business use. It is a good idea to have one of these as it means that the information going around the network cannot be access by someone who is not on the network and as such it will be protected heavily. This can also be used to speed up communications as there would be less traffic in the way of the information. 

### Separate systems

Another way to reduce the probability of getting information stolen would be to have the information go through separate systems that all have their distinct jobs. This would mean that seat booking on the flights would go through a small closed off system that would make it hard for the information to be intercepted. This will also mean that there would be less traffic that contains raw data going around the system and this would be generally more secure. Finally it would also allow for easier setup and structure as all of the systems would be distinct and data would be less likely to get lost along the way. 

### Passwords / Accounts

With the addition f user accounts and permission levels among the systems this would have the effect that people would only be allowed to access the files and settings that they need. This would mean that the information of the server that is very critical and secretive cannot be access by anyone on the system and only by the people who would need to access it. This would therefore make hacking the system harder as you would have to have access to a high up account and not just a typical employee and the high up people would have far stringer passwords. 

### Firewall

The final type of software security that you could have on a system like for an airline would be a firewall as this would block all types of packets that are not allowed in the network and this would be good for the network that an airline company would have as it could block the packets from someone who is try to steal the information automatically without intervention from a person.  

## D1 - discuss different ways from recovering from a disaster 

In this section I will be going through the different ways that companies can recover from a disaster and how they can recover from it. A disaster can happen in many ways but in general it would mean that some data that is needed on the system has been removed r  that the system is
