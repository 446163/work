## Introduction

In this assignment, I will be going through help for the program in terms of user help that they can access as well as technical documentation for support of the program.  

## P6 - Create on-screen help to assist users of a computer program

For this first section I will be going through the help that is available to the users of the Music player program that I have created.  

Whenever you create a program that people will actually be using there is a need to create a help section that they can access, this is so that they know go to use the program and can potentially fix and problems if they go wrong. For the program that I have created there will be a help guide and this will be accessed by pressing the F1 key when you are focused on the program when this happens a web browser will open to display the following page:

> # Music Player help Page
> ##ã€€controls
> ### Play Pause button
> When this button is pressed the state of the music will toggle between a playing and a paused state. Therefore if the music is playing when you press the button then the music will pause, and vice versa. 
> ### Forwards button
> When you press this button the music will go to another random song that you have on your machine and start playing it from the beginning, if you are halfway through a song then it will  
> ###Back button
> When you press this button the song will go back to the beginning of the current song that is playing, but if you then press the button again within a second then you will hear the song that you heard before this one. This means that you can press the button once to go back to the beginning of the song that you are listening to or you can double press the button to go back a song in the list. 
> ## Common problems
> ### The music player is not playing a certain song on my machine
> check that all of the music that you have actually works and is not corrupt of badly named, when you have checked this you will need to remove the .cache file that is in your home folder of your machine. Be careful as this will be a hidden file so you will need to be able to see those in your file browser. 
> ### The music player will not go back to the previous song 
> again, ensure that all of the music that you want to play is actually a valid music format and that they are all named correctly. You will then need to remove the .history file that is in your main file directory location   

## M4 - Create technical documentation for the support and maintenance once of a program
In this section I will go though and show you some technical documentation for the program. This technical documentation would be used when there is someone who is setting up or maintaining the program for other people or would be given to the person who takes over this program from me if I were to stop maintaining it. For this documentation I will need to include the way that the program works as well as
