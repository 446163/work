## Introduction

In this assignment, I will be going through help for the program in terms of user help that they can access as well as technical documentation for support of the program.  

## P6 - Create on-screen help to assist users of a computer program

For this first section I will be going through the help that is available to the users of the Music player program that I have created.  

Whenever you create a program that people will actually be using there is a need to create a help section that they can access, this is so that they know go to use the program and can potentially fix and problems if they go wrong. For the program that I have created there will be a help guide and this will be accessed by pressing the F1 key when you are focused on the program when this happens a web browser will open to display the following page:

> # Music Player help Page
> ##　controls
> ### Play Pause button
> When this button is pressed the state of the music will toggle between a playing and a paused state. Therefore if the music is playing when you press the button then the music will pause, and vice versa. 
> ### Forwards button
> When you press this button the music will go to another random song that you have on your machine and start playing it from the beginning, if you are halfway through a song then it will  
> ###Back button
> When you press this button the song will go back to the beginning of the current song that is playing, but if you then press the button again within a second then you will hear the song that you heard before this one. This means that you can press the button once to go back to the beginning of the song that you are listening to or you can double press the button to go back a song in the list. 
> ## Common problems
> ### The music player is not playing a certain song on my machine
> check that all of the music that you have actually works and is not corrupt of badly named, when you have checked this you will need to remove the .cache file that is in your home folder of your machine. Be careful as this will be a hidden file so you will need to be able to see those in your file browser. 
> ### The music player will not go back to the previous song 
> again, ensure that all of the music that you want to play is actually a valid music format and that they are all named correctly. You will then need to remove the .history file that is in your main file directory location   

## M4 - Create technical documentation for the support and maintenance once of a program
In this section I will go though and show you some technical documentation for the program. This technical documentation would be used when there is someone who is setting up or maintaining the program for other people or would be given to the person who takes over this program from me if I were to stop maintaining it. For this documentation I will need to include the way that the program works as well as the functions that are in the program and the variables that are used. When asked for the documentation this is an example of what I would give them:

> # Music player technical documentation
> ## functions
> ### main
> input / output: this is the main function that runs the program and has all of the logic to it. Due to this it well return a value of 0 when it closes and that is it for return values. In addition to this due to the fact that it is the main function there is no input for it as it will just run with no value. 

> functionality: the main loop covers the functionality of the window and program logic, the only thing that it does not do it the actual calling of the music api in windows as that is the purpose of the MusicControl function.  
> ### MusicControl
> input / output: this function is a void function as these is no need for the function to return any values, it just calls the music api. However it does have input and this is in the form of a char const list. This is used to get the correct functionality from the music and can have values like "play" and "pause" when running the function. 
> functionality: all that this function does is control the Windows music api so that the music can play pause and to on. 
> ## variables
> MusicStatus: this is used in the main function to keep track of the music state when pausing and playing as it is in a separate scope to the actual music state. This can take the form of text like "paused" or "playing".
> program.status: this is used to know when the program is to be closed as when you press the red x button in windows this variable will be set to 0 and when that happens the program will close as it needs to. This can take the value of "0" or "1". 
> inp: this is used as the input for the program and it set based on the button that is pressed on the programs main interface, this is then used to call the MusicControl function as it is needed. This can take the value of "back",  "forward" etc,,,
> state: This is used in the Music control function and it the internal way of knowing how the function was called so that the appropriate api calls can be made. This can take values of "Play", "Pause" and so on. 

### user documentation

> ##　controls
> ### Play Pause button
> When this button is pressed the state of the music will toggle between a playing and a paused state. Therefore if the music is playing when you press the button then the music will pause, and vice versa. 
> ### Forwards button

> ###Back button
> When you press this button the song will go back to the beginning of the current song that is playing, but if you then press the button again within a second then you will hear the song that you heard before this one. This means that you can press the button once to go back to the beginning of the song that you are listening to or you can double press the button to go back a song in the list. 

### requirement specification 

In order to make the program work all that you will need is a full and valid install of windows 7 or above as this program only uses the inbuilt functions and api that the windows media player uses.
