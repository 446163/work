## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the design and the and features that exist within databases and how different databases work. In addition to this I will be going though the different types of database there are and how they will work for certain customers. Finally, I will go through how errors that are in the database can be fixed and what problems they could cause. 

## P1 - Explain the features of a relational database 

In this first section I will be going through the features of databases in a general case as well as what these features are and what they actually do. I will go through what both entities and attributes as and how they work. In addition to this I will also go through the use of the primary and foreign keys and how they are used in relational databases to relate two pieces of information. Finally, I will go through how data can be validated when it is entered into a database and how this works and all of these will have examples with them that I will use to explain them. 

### Entities 

To start off with I will explain what an entity is, in a database an entity is the most basic and initial part that is used in storing information as the entity is the 'thing' that you are storing the information about and as such you will need one if you want to store any meaningful information. For example, lets say that you have a database that is designed for use within a video rental store, and it will be used to keep track of the videos that people are borrowing and for how long and so on. In this case, a good example of an entity would be 'customer' or 'videos', this is because these are things that you would want to store information about in the database. The entities can also be placed in a table of all the same type so that they can all be seen, for example you could have a table that just contains information about the customers and that would make sense. A final note that I will go on to explain later is how all the entities relate and how the entities will be either one to one, one to many or many, for example a customer could borrow multiple videos at the same time and so there would be a one to many relation between the customer and the videos database. So as you can now see, an entity is just the thing that you want to store the information about.

### Attributes

In addition to the entity, another main factor that needs to be in a database is the attributes that the entity has. In a basic sense, the attributes are the information that an entity holds. This is therefore needed as if you just have a table named 'customer' with no attributes then you will have no information. For example, if you had the same database that was going to be used with the video store then the table with the name of 'customer' will store information like 'Customer_ID', 'First_name', 'Surname', 'Address' and so on. With this you can then store the information that you need to about the customer in the database and it will all work fine. From this you can see that the entity in a database is the general type of information that you want to store and the attributes are the actual types of information that you will be storing about that entity and then you get down to the actual information. This is then useful for a business as it means that the information will be sorted and all in the correct place so that later in the process everything is a lot easier and works well which is why this would be useful for businesses. 

### Entity relation

To start off with I will need to explain what primary and foreign keys are before I can explain how they relate tables together. The primary key is a very simple concept as it is just a unique value for a certain row in a table in a database. This value is required to be unique as otherwise it cannot perform its function, however in addition to this, the key must also not be null. With this in place for each table that you create you well now have the ability to use the database as a relational database as you can now relate the tables using this primary key. But in order to do this you will need to use the foreign key. The foreign key is used when you want to include the information from another table without actually re-entering the information. If you think of the primary key like a web address that contains the information then the foreign key would be the pointer to the that web address. This helps as it means that incited of having the same information in the database over and over again you can just say that to the program that you can access the information over here in this other table as I do not have it. This will then save a huge amount of space in the database so you can store more data and it will be more useful. 

### Data validation

When you input information into a database you would want to ensure that all the information is correct as otherwise you could get errors in the database when you try to do something that you want to but the information is invalid, or you could end up sending information to the incorrect person and so on... In order to ensure that this does not happen all the data must be valid as in the end human error will eventually result in an incorrect entry. In order to combat this you would need the computer to look at what the users put in and ensure that it is valid data and what they wanted to put in. Obviously the computer cannot read the mind of the user, so it would not be able to correct a date input from '02/04/2017' to '02/04/2017' as both the dates are valid so the computer would not be able to correct it. But the computer would be able to spot other errors and alert them to the user. For example, if the user was inputting a date then the computer will expect to get a date inputted like '02/04/2017' but if it instead got 'Steve' then the computer will know that there is an error with the input as it does not match the expected format of 'dd/mm/yyyy' so it can alert the user and they can then input the correct information. In a level above this the computer could correct an input such as '31/02/2017' because that date does not exist. As you can see this can get a lot more complicated with certain dates and lengths and so on. But this is how a computer can validate information and ensure that the data is correct. 

## P2 - Design a relational database for a specified user need  

## M1 - Explain referential integrity and the purpose of primary keys in building the relationships between tables  

In this section I will be going through and explaining how integrity is kept in a relational database and how this works and deals with errors with examples to help explain it.

### How referential integrity is set

To start off with I will need to explain what is meant by the term referential integrity and what it actually means. If you recall to the P1 section earlier I explained how you can connect two different tables within a relational database with the use of primary and foreign keys, but when you do this the database will be full of all the connections between different tables and it can become very complicated and interconnected. With this all in place a small change to a table's layout or the removal of a row could then mean that the relations that you have would be incorrect and could point to incorrect information or information that does not exist anymore and as such the database could fail to work properly. This is where the database software would step in with referential integrity to ensure that the data will stay valid and properly referenced. There is no specific software that is used to do this as any good database software will to this. 

### What errors are detected

When using the database software the referential integrity checker is set to detect certain types of errors within the database and in this section I will go through a brief list of what a few of these could be and how it can detect them. One of the main types of errors that is detected by the referential integrity checker is a reference to data that does not exist anymore. This error is very simple to detect as when the referential integrity checker goes through the database it will check the data that the foreign key relates to and then it will not be able to find the primary key that it relates to and as such it will produce an error for a someone to see so that it can be corrected or in some cases it can be corrected automatically. Another example of an error that could be detected would be where the data that has been related to is not of the expected type and as such, if it were to be processed then it would produce an error and the system may crash. This relates to the part in P1 where I explained about the expected input and how the system will expect something and then might get another. For example, the system might be expecting to get data about a customer and then use the information to get their name and so on, but if the incorrect foreign key is used then the system would not have the correct information and so could not carry on. In most cases if this was to happen then the system would not run the incorrect information but would instead produce an error to let a user know that the system ran into an error. This would then mean that the system would stay up and the problem could get fixed. 

### How these errors can be corrected

When the errors that have been described there are two main ways that the error can be corrected, one is by the system automatically and the other is a human correcting the mistake manually. The human correction is the one that is the most simple to explain as in this case a human who is working on the system will receive a message from the system that will alert them to the error as explained in the previous section and in this case the human will then go through the database with the pointers from the message and fix the problem. For example, say that the system alerted the admin to the fact that the system tried to look up a foreign key but there was no primary key that it related to, in this case the admin would then have to look through the database and find out where that foreign key was supposed to point to and then the admin would have to find the correct reference and fix it manually. As you can imagine this would take a long time and can be caused by a very small mistake, even so this is one of the main costs of running and maintaining database and as such there are people dedicated to this. But this is starting to be at least partially replaced by the use of computers fixing the problem themselves without any human interaction in the process but this is still in the very initial stages as it is basically a form of AI. One basic way that this can work is that the database will find the data that it expects to be the correct data it needed if an error happened and then use that data as if it was originally the data it was supposed to use. For example if the video rental store had a mismatched foreign key that pointed to no data but the system was expecting to process customers first names, then the system will modify the key so that it points to that table and then carry on. When this happens though the system will need to then make a note of what it changed in case it did something wrong so that a person will know how to fix it. As you can imagine, this can lead to some undesired consequences and so its practical use is limited. 

### How data can be recovered from multiple tables

When data is recovered from the table through the use of the primary and foreign keys the data is linked into the table that has the foreign key from the table that has the primary key. This is actually very simple in the way that it works as the keys just point to where the information can be found and it is taken from there. In all the examples that I have given so far I have only explained what happens when the information is linked from one table to another table. However, the process that is used for when you like more that one table is the same with no differences at all. All that would happen in this case is that the database software will just find the primary key in some other tables at the same time it is looking and so it will work as normal.
