## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the design and the and features that exist within databases and how different databases work. In addition to this I will be going though the different types of database there are and how they will work for certain customers. Finally, I will go through how errors that are in the database can be fixed and what problems they could cause. 

## P1 - Explain the features of a relational database 

In this first section I will be going through the features of databases in a general case as well as what these features are and what they actually do. I will go through what both entities and attributes as and how they work. In addition to this I will also go through the use of the primary and foreign keys and how they are used in relational databases to relate two pieces of information. Finally, I will go through how data can be validated when it is entered into a database and how this works and all of these will have examples with them that I will use to explain them. 

### Entities 

To start off with I will explain what an entity is, in a database an entity is the most basic and initial part that is used in storing information as the entity is the 'thing' that you are storing the information about and as such you will need one if you want to store any meaningful information. For example, lets say that you have a database that is designed for use within a video rental store, and it will be used to keep track of the videos that people are borrowing and for how long and so on. In this case, a good example of an entity would be 'customer' or 'videos', this is because these are things that you would want to store information about in the database. The entities can also be placed in a table of all the same type so that they can all be seen, for example you could have a table that just contains information about the customers and that would make sense. A final note that I will go on to explain later is how all the entities relate and how the entities will be either one to one, one to many or many, for example a customer could borrow multiple videos at the same time and so there would be a one to many relation between the customer and the videos database. So as you can now see, an entity is just the thing that you want to store the information about.

### Attributes

In addition to the entity, another main factor that needs to be in a database is the attributes that the entity has. In a basic sense, the attributes are the information that an entity holds. This is therefore needed as if you just have a table named 'customer' with no attributes then you will have no information. For example, if you had the same database that was going to be used with the video store then the table with the name of 'customer' will store information like 'Customer_ID', 'First_name', 'Surname', 'Address' and so on. With this you can then store the information that you need to about the customer in the database and it will all work fine. From this you can see that the entity in a database is the general type of information that you want to store and the attributes are the actual types of information that you will be storing about that entity and then you get down to the actual information. This is then useful for a business as it means that the information will be sorted and all in the correct place so that later in the process everything is a lot easier and works well which is why this would be useful for businesses. 

### Entity relation

To start off with I will need to explain what primary and foreign keys are before I can explain how they relate tables together. The primary key is a very simple concept as it is just a unique value for a certain row in a table in a database. This value is required to be unique as otherwise it cannot perform its function, however in addition to this, the key must also not be null. With this in place for each table that you create you well now have the ability to use the database as a relational database as you can now relate the tables using this primary key. But in order to do this you will need to use the foreign key. The foreign key is used when you want to include the information from another table without actually re-entering the information. If you think of the primary key like a web address that contains the information then the foreign key would be the pointer to the that web address. This helps as it means that incited of having the same information in the database over and over again you can just say that to the program that you can access the information over here in this other table as I do not have it. This will then save a huge amount of space in the database so you can store more data and it will be more useful. 

### Data validation

When you input information into a database you would want to ensure that all the information is correct as otherwise you could get errors in the database when you try to do something that you want to but the information is invalid, or you could end up sending information to the incorrect person and so on... In order to ensure that this does not happen all the data must be valid as in the end human error will eventually result in an incorrect entry. In order to combat this you would need the computer to look at what the users put in and ensure that it is valid data and what they wanted to put in. Obviously the computer cannot read the mind of the user, so it would not be able to correct a date input from '02/04/2017' to '02/04/2017' as both the dates are valid so the computer would not be able to correct it. But the computer would be able to spot other errors and alert them to the user. For example, if the user was inputting a date then the computer will expect to get a date inputted like '02/04/2017' but if it instead got 'Steve' then the computer will know that there is an error with the input as it does not match the expected format of 'dd/mm/yyyy' so it can alert the user and they can then input the correct information. In a level above this the computer could correct an input such as '31/02/2017' because that date does not exist. As you can see this can get a lot more complicated with certain dates and lengths and so on. But this is how a computer can validate information and ensure that the data is correct. 

## P2 - Design a relational database for a specified user need  

In this section I will be going through the design that is required for a database and for this I will be going through normalisation to 3NF, Entity relationship diagram as well as a data dictionary. To start off with i will explain each one and then i will go through the drawn out example and how it works and relates. 

### Normalisation to 3NF

To start off with I will need to explain what is meant by normalisation and the 3 different normalisation methods that relate and include 3NF and these are:

* 1NF
* 2NF
* 3NF

These are all ways of normalising databases so that there is less redundancy of data, so that there is less of the same data in the database and instead of being re written it is referenced instead. All the 3 different methods listed above have varying levels of normalisation with the 1NF having the least and the 2NF having the most. 

#### 1NF

The way that the 1NF normalisation works is very simple, a database will be 1NF normalised if each cell in a table has only one pace of information and there are no duplicate rows. This may seem to be simple and just a basic structure that you should follow for your database but it is the requirements for 1NF normalisation. 

#### 2NF

Past this there is 2NF normalisation and this is a bit more complicated, The way that this works is that all the information in the database should be related to the primary key and so there should be no data that is copied across the rows. For example, the table below would be a table that would not be 2NF normalised:

(first two columns are the primary key)
                                           
|CourseID | TermID     | #Places  | Course Name  |
|---------|------------|----------|--------------|
|   01    |   2016-1   | 100      | Programming  |
|   01    |   2016-2   | 100      | Programming  |
|   02    |   2016-1   | 200      | Databases    |
|   02    |   2017-1   | 150      | Databases    |
|   03    |   2016-2   | 120      | Web Design   |

The reason tat this is not 2NF normalised is due to the fact that the 'course name' column contains information that is redundant and the same in multiple columns, due to this or is not related to the primary key. The way to fix this would be to remove the 'Course Name' column from this table and place it in its own table where it can be related to the rest of the database in a non-redundant way as you can see below:

CourseID    |  Course Name |
------------| -------------|
01       | Programming  |
02       | Databases    |
03       | Web Design   |

Now the course names and ID's are all linked and make sense. 

#### 3NF

3NF just takes the idea that was there with the 2NF and then extends that idea slightly to a place where there are two tables that will be different in the same place and the relating those, what I mean by this is if you had a column that was the ID of the teachers for the course and then you also had a column that was about the names of the teachers for those lessons then these columns would have the same information but its just displayed in a slightly different way with one being an ID and the other a name. Here is what it would look like in practise:

Course  |   Term     |  #Places   |  TeacherID  | TeacherName  |
--------|------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
IT101   |   2009-1   |  100       |  332        |  Mr Jones    |
IT101   |   2009-2   |  100       |  332        |  Mr Jones    |
IT102   |   2009-1   |  200       |  495        |  Mr Bentley  |
IT102   |   2010-1   |  150       |  332        |  Mr Jones    |
IT103   |   2009-2   |  120       |  242        |  Mrs Smith   |

In order to fix this you would just need to ensure that there was a small separate table that would relate the TeacherID to the Teachername and this would then solve this so that the database will have no redundancy and will be perfect. Now your database will have no redundancy and will be 3NF normalised so that it is organised properly. Here is an extract from the database so that you can see it follows along with the 3NF normalisamtion:

# TOO MANY THINGS TO DO

### Entity Relationship Diagram

An entity relationship diagram is a way of laying out and defining how certain parts of a relational database will be put together and what / how they will communicate. For example, below is an Entity Relationship Diagram that I found on-line so that I can describe how it all works:

![Erd Diagram](https://xidey.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/sample-db-erd.png)

As you can see, the tables in the example above will relate and stand for the tables that you will have in the actual relational database as the different entities. From here you can see the arrows that are pointing between the different tables will relate to how the information will be passed between the different tables so for example, the order item tables will be the reference for information that is needed in the order and the product tables and so that is what the arrow indicates. So as you can see, the order item table has a relation of one to one with the order table as there will only be one order per item being ordered, furthermore there is a many to one relation between the person and the order table as there will be many orders to one person but multiple people cannot have the same order. Below is the Entity Relation Diagram that will be in place for my database:

# DO THIS

### Data Dictionary

A data dictionary is a way to layout and list all of the data types of the variables that are used in the database in a sort and concise format that is all arranged in a table, with this you would list the name of the variable, the field size and the data type. This is only a simple data dictionary but they can contain much more information and notes and so on. Here is an example of what one would look like so that I can explain the features of it and how it works:

![Data dictonary](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/datadictionary-140327103930-phpapp02/95/data-dictionary-1-638.jpg?cb=1395917008)

As you can see here the data is stored in a table and that table has the headings of name type and so on, from just quickly looking at this table you can get a good idea of what the data dictionary that I will create will look like. And This is what I have come up with:

# DO THIS AS WELL

### Front End Design

In this final section I will be going through the front end design of the database and how people are actually going to use it to input data and information as per the specifications. For this section there will be 3 drawn designs as well as a report and query design on inserted pieces of paper.

## M1 - Explain referential integrity and the purpose of primary keys in building the relationships between tables  

In this section I will be going through and explaining how integrity is kept in a relational database and how this works and deals with errors with examples to help explain it.

### How referential integrity is set

To start off with I will need to explain what is meant by the term referential integrity and what it actually means. If you recall to the P1 section earlier I explained how you can connect two different tables within a relational database with the use of primary and foreign keys, but when you do this the database will be full of all the connections between different tables and it can become very complicated and interconnected. With this all in place a small change to a table's layout or the removal of a row could then mean that the relations that you have would be incorrect and could point to incorrect information or information that does not exist anymore and as such the database could fail to work properly. This is where the database software would step in with referential integrity to ensure that the data will stay valid and properly referenced. There is no specific software that is used to do this as any good database software will to this. 

### What errors are detected

When using the database software the referential integrity checker is set to detect certain types of errors within the database and in this section I will go through a brief list of what a few of these could be and how it can detect them. One of the main types of errors that is detected by the referential integrity checker is a reference to data that does not exist anymore. This error is very simple to detect as when the referential integrity checker goes through the database it will check the data that the foreign key relates to and then it will not be able to find the primary key that it relates to and as such it will produce an error for a someone to see so that it can be corrected or in some cases it can be corrected automatically. Another example of an error that could be detected would be where the data that has been related to is not of the expected type and as such, if it were to be processed then it would produce an error and the system may crash. This relates to the part in P1 where I explained about the expected input and how the system will expect something and then might get another. For example, the system might be expecting to get data about a customer and then use the information to get their name and so on, but if the incorrect foreign key is used then the system would not have the correct information and so could not carry on. In most cases if this was to happen then the system would not run the incorrect information but would instead produce an error to let a user know that the system ran into an error. This would then mean that the system would stay up and the problem could get fixed. 

### How these errors can be corrected

When the errors that have been described there are two main ways that the error can be corrected, one is by the system automatically and the other is a human correcting the mistake manually. The human correction is the one that is the most simple to explain as in this case a human who is working on the system will receive a message from the system that will alert them to the error as explained in the previous section and in this case the human will then go through the database with the pointers from the message and fix the problem. For example, say that the system alerted the admin to the fact that the system tried to look up a foreign key but there was no primary key that it related to, in this case the admin would then have to look through the database and find out where that foreign key was supposed to point to and then the admin would have to find the correct reference and fix it manually. As you can imagine this would take a long time and can be caused by a very small mistake, even so this is one of the main costs of running and maintaining database and as such there are people dedicated to this. But this is starting to be at least partially replaced by the use of computers fixing the problem themselves without any human interaction in the process but this is still in the very initial stages as it is basically a form of AI. One basic way that this can work is that the database will find the data that it expects to be the correct data it needed if an error happened and then use that data as if it was originally the data it was supposed to use. For example if the video rental store had a mismatched foreign key that pointed to no data but the system was expecting to process customers first names, then the system will modify the key so that it points to that table and then carry on. When this happens though the system will need to then make a note of what it changed in case it did something wrong so that a person will know how to fix it. As you can imagine, this can lead to some undesired consequences and so its practical use is limited. 

### How data can be recovered from multiple tables

When data is recovered from the table through the use of the primary and foreign keys the data is linked into the table that has the foreign key from the table that has the primary key. This is actually very simple in the way that it works as the keys just point to where the information can be found and it is taken from there. In all the examples that I have given so far I have only explained what happens when the information is linked from one table to another table. However, the process that is used for when you like more that one table is the same with no differences at all. All that would happen in this case is that the database software will just find the primary key in some other tables at the same time it is looking and so it will work as normal. 

## D1 - Discuss how potential errors in the design and construction of a database can be avoided 

In this section I will be going through how potential errors in databases can be avoided as well as the what these errors could do. However, for this section I will be going through the errors that are in the actual design and construction of the database rather than errors that are in the actual input and interaction of the database. 

The main error that can occur and happen due to an incorrect set-up of the system would be that there are incorrect data types that are used for the attributes section for the entities in the database. The way that this will create an error is that it will set a certain type of information to go into a certain attribute cell and then only that information will be able to go into that cell. This is good as it means that the information cannot be entered incorrectly as otherwise an error will be displayed and this will mean that only a valid input will be allowed making the database keep its integrity. If this was not in place then the data entered might be of the incorrect type and then when the information would be processed, the computer / software would come across an error and if the software was designed in a bad way then it could crash and take down the whole system, on the other hand, if the system was well designed then the system as a whole would stay up but the process that you were trying to do would not complete. This could then lead to the system not working and so it is not able to do what it was designed to do and that is not good. Due to this you can see that this would be a good thing to have bud this well rely on the system being correctly being set up in the first place. If the system is set up incorrectly in the first place then it would not allow the users of the system to input the data that they need to input and as such the system will not work correctly. The way that this can be avoided is by ensuring that the system is checked over to ensure that all of the data types are correct, if this is not enough due to the fact that the system is large then a program can be written that will detect the problems that it has. 

This previous method then relates to another one of ensuring that the data is valid and this is that the data that is entered is valid to a further level than just ensuring that it is of the correct data type. The way that this works is that the database software will go through the database every so often and perform sanity checks on the data to ensure that it is all still correct and actually makes sense. For example the software might check to ensure that the data you put in actually exists and will happen, an example of this could be the 31set of February. Although it might be a valid date and fit the model for dates, the system can work out that this will not be a date and so they will know that there is an error. However, a more ways that this can work and these ways can lead to a more advanced system but can also lead to more problems depending on how well it is set up. This way is through the use of the system checking all put based on how that input would work with the company and how they run their business. One way tat this could work is that the company could be a video rental company and as such they set the maximum time that you could borrow a DVD for to be 5 weeks, with this as a rule that the company follows the database software would then be able to alert the user if they happen to enter an incorrect date and has such they would be able to ensure that no errors or mistakes would happen and a customer is not charged too much. Another way that this can work is that the company could set it up so that the all the films must have a Title and a runtime that is in a valid format. With this rule the database software would be able to alert the user if the data that they put in was not correct and they missed one of the inputs and this would lead to a better database of their films. This checking software is not too different from the one listed before it is just that in this case the software has a set of values for what it can correct predefined for the user and that it also checks for those in the database as well and as you can see this would stop errors that would happen due to the design of the database as you just have to ensure that it is set up properly in the first place to ensure that the database will be constructed properly. 

Another example of a potential error in a database that could occur and fixed with correct design and construction of the database would be the deletion of fields accidentally. As you can think, there would be many reasons why the deletion of part of the database would be not very good. A few reasons that this would not be good is that the data contained could be vital to the running and operation of the company and if it is lost then the company would not be able to run the business as they normally do. For example, this information could be the details for a customers or many of them and if this information is lost then the customers would not have any information in the company and this could mean that they would not return to that shop and the company could lose money. In order to fix this there are two methods that should be put in place, the first is that the system should warn the user if they were to delete a field or block all users apart from the admin of the database to delete records from the database. The second option is that there should always be a backup of the data base so that if any information is deleted then it can be recovered to a certain state quickly with minimal loss of other information. For the first option three could be certain levels of user accounts within the database that allow or block a certain employees access to certain parts of the database that they do not need and this would then men that only an admin of the database would be able to delete the records from the database, so therefore only the admin could do database breaking operations and the average employee would only be able to change some records depending on what part of the company they where in so a front desk employee would only be able to change the records tat are to do with who has taken out a DVD from the store. The second plan that should happen is that the database should be backed up a regular intervals to ensure that the information is contained in some way. The way that you would backup the database would depend on the size of the database but in most cases small and frequent incremental backups would be the best and then less often large whole system backups should be taken. This will then mean that the company would have all of the information that hey need and be able to access and back it up quickly. If this was not in place then once some data was deleted from the database then the company would not be able to recover the data and it would be lost forever with no backup and should not happen and so a backup should.
