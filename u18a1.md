## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the design and the and features that exist within databases and how different databases work. In addition to this I will be going though the different types of database there are and how they will work for certain customers. Finally, I will go through how errors that are in the database can be fixed and what problems they could cause. 

## P1 - Explain the features of a relational database 

In this first section I will be going through the features of databases in a general case as well as what these features are and what they actually do. I will go through what both entities and attributes as and how they work. In addition to this I will also go through the use of the primary and foreign keys and how they are used in relational databases to relate two pieces of information. Finally, I will go through how data can be validated when it is entered into a database and how this works and all of these will have examples with them that I will use to explain them. 

### Entities 

To start off with I will explain what an entity is, in a database an entity is the most basic and initial part that is used in storing information as the entity is the 'thing' that you are storing the information about and as such you will need one if you want to store any meaningful information. For example, lets say that you have a database that is designed for use within a video rental store, and it will be used to keep track of the videos that people are borrowing and for how long and so on. In this case, a good example of an entity would be 'customer' or 'videos', this is because these are things that you would want to store information about in the database. The entities can also be placed in a table of all the same type so that they can all be seen, for example you could have a table that just contains information about the customers and that would make sense. A final note that I will go on to explain later is how all the entities relate and how the entities will be either one to one, one to many or many, for example a customer could borrow multiple videos at the same time and so there would be a one to many relation between the customer and the videos database. So as you can now see, an entity is just the thing that you want to store the information about.

### Attributes

In addition to the entity, another main factor that needs to be in a database is the attributes that the entity has. In a basic sense, the attributes are the information that an entity holds. This is therefore needed as if you just have a table named 'customer' with no attributes then you will have no information. For example, if you had the same database that was going to be used with the video store then the table with the name of 'customer' will store information like 'Customer_ID', 'First_name', 'Surname', 'Address' and so on. With this you can then store the information that you need to about the customer in the database and it will all work fine. From this you can see that the entity in a database is the general type of information that you want to store and the attributes are the actual types of information that you will be storing about that entity and then you get down to the actual information. This is then useful for a business as it means that the information will be sorted and all in the correct place so that later in the process everything is a lot easier and works well which is why this would be useful for businesses. 

### Entity relation

To start off with I will need to explain what primary and foreign keys are before I can explain how they relate tables together. The primary key is a very simple concept as it is just a unique value for a certain row in a table in a database. This value is required to be unique as otherwise it cannot perform its function, however in addition to this, the key must also not be null. With this in place for each table that you create you well now have the ability to use the database as a relational database as you can now relate the tables using this primary key. But in order to do this you will need to use the foreign key. The foreign key is used when you want to include the information from another table without actually re-entering the information. If you think of the primary key like a web address that contains the information then the foreign key would be the pointer to the that web address. This helps as it means that incited of having the same information in the database over and over again you can just say that to the program that you can access the information over here in this other table as I do not have it. This will then save a huge amount of space in the database so you can store more data and it will be more useful. 

### Data validation

When you input information into a database you would want to ensure that all the information is correct as otherwise you could get errors in the database when you try to do something that you want to but the information is invalid, or you could end up sending information to the incorrect person and so on... In order to ensure that this does not happen all the data must be valid as in the end human error will eventually result in an incorrect entry. In order to combat this you would need the computer to look at what the users put in and ensure that it is valid data and what they wanted to put in. Obviously the computer cannot read the mind of the user, so it would not be able to correct a date input from '02/04/2017' to '02/04/2017' as both the dates are valid so the computer would not be able to correct it. But the computer would be able to spot other errors and alert them to the user. For example, if the user was inputting a date then the computer will expect to get a date inputted like '02/04/2017' but if it instead got 'Steve' then the computer will know that there is an error with the input as it does not match the expected format of 'dd/mm/yyyy' so it can alert the user and they can then input the correct information. In a level above this the computer could correct an input such as '31/02/2017' because that date does not exist. As you can see this can get a lot more complicated with certain dates and lengths and so on. But this is how a computer can validate information and ensure that the data is correct.
