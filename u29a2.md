## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the steps and processes that are required to install and upgrade software on a machine. For this I will be planning and recording the installation of software onto the machine as well as explaining how the customer acceptance process is important and how this can be made better. Finally I will be creating a procedure that I will use to backup all of the information and data as well as justifying why I have upgraded the software that I have. One important thing to note here is that I will be installing the software and upgrades into a Linux system and as such I will be using the command line to do so so the process may not look the same, but I will explain it as I go through. 

## P3 - Plan an installation and upgrade
 
In this section I will be going through and installing some software onto my desktop, for this I will also talk about different aspects for the installation, and these are:

* Planning 
* testing 
* Delivery 
* shipping
* storage
* software specs 
* communication
* logs
* security
* confidentially
* contractual requirements

Furthermore, the software that I will be installing is Libre office. This is an office quite similar to Microsoft office, but is available for free and has much of the functionality. Finally the upgrade that I will be doing will be just some general software that is installed on my computer.


 
## P4 - Record and complete a software installation

In this section I will actually be going through and installing Libre office on to my desktop. The way that I will be doing this is through the use of the command line updating tool for my Linux type: arch Linux. The way that updating work is Linux is that a remote file server contains all the software, and the computer downloads and unzips them to install them. This basically puts all of the software that you have on your computer into one system that sets it all up for you. The way that i do this is: ***pacman -S software_name***. Pacman is the name for the PACage MANager which is the process that unifies the software and actually makes it work on my computer. The -S on the end tells the package manager to sync the software with the software on the file servers, this will then download the software and then install it on my computer. So basically this is how I will be installing the software on my machine as it is very simple to do and explain, with the added bonus that this will also download all the other software that the program needs as well, you will see all this in the images below. Finally the software_name is the name of the software that you want to install. 
 
## P5 - record and complete a software upgrade

In this section I will be going through and upgrading the operating system on my computer. When I say this I mean that I will be updating Linux as a new version has been released and is available for my computer. This process is very similar to the previous example as I will also be using the command line to do this with.

To start off with, what actually is the Linux that I will be upgrading and how will I actually upgrade it. Put simply, Linux is the basic operating system that controls and organises everything that is on my computer and this is run as a process that is constantly running in the background. When I am updating this I am changing the code that that will be running. And the command that i will use for this is: ***pacman -Syu*** Again, the pacman part is the package manager that sorts this all out. But the -Syu part in this case will check all of the software in my machine and check it it has been flagged for an update, if so then it will sync with the file servers and download the new parts of the software and install it for you. 

Finally in addition to this I will be showing the output of the command ***uname -r***. The command will tell me the current version of Linux that I am running so it will be used to show if the upgrade has succeeded or not.

![Initial Version](u29img/initialversionFIX.png)

So to start off with here is the current version of the Linux that my computer is running. As you can see it is 4.6.12-1-ARCH, this tells me that I am running Linux version 4.8 and tart I am using the distribution of arch Linux. This is what I will upgrade. Now telling the computer the update command we see that there is an update to the core Linux software, so there is an update to the operating system: 

![Initial installation](u29img/initialinstallFIX.png)

The first few lines of output from this command show that my system is currently downloading the new lists of all the software that is available via the package manager as well as what versions they are. After that the package manager looked on the software on the computer and saw that the Linux software from the core file server was flagged for an update. But in order to download the software the package manager will  need to check for any additional software that will need to be downloaded in order for the actual installation of the Linux software to work properly, these are called the dependencies. This is became the core software that you are updating depends on these additional software packages to run and work, but in this case there was no additional software that needed to be downloaded so it can just be downloaded by itself. On the same line as the name of the software being updated we can also see the old and the new version that will be installed, as previous command showed the old version of Linux that I an running on this machine now is 4.8.12-1 and that this update will upgrade this software to the new version of 4.8.12-2 as expected. In addition to this it also shows you the total net change that the software will have and that is calculated to be the difference in disk size between the new and the old version, so it will use up 3.33MiB more space on my computer. Finally on that line it shows that the amount of software that will be downloaded and that is 60MiB so I know that it will not take long. On the three lines below that it then goes on to show the summary of the downloading like just explained, this is put in place for when you are updating multiple pieces of software as it will sum those values up for you so you get a total. Finally it then asks if I want to carry on and actually install and upgrade the software rather than just seeing what is to be upgraded. 

At this stage I just type in y or enter and the software will start to download as shown in the image below. 

![after installation](u29img/afterinstallFIX.png)

So here is what the terminal looks like after you have updated the software and as you can see the initial installation question and summary is still there. Directly after the previous picture we see that the package manager instantly starts downloading the packages (software) that needs to be upgraded. And as you can see this is the 60MiB it says it would be and at the internet speed of 12MiB per second we can also see that this took only 5 seconds to complete. The bars at the side were used to display the progress when the actual downloading of the software was happening. The next five lines then go through and check that the software that was downloaded will actually work. It does this by making sure that the software on the computer exactly matches the software that it should be be checking that all the values are in the appropriate places. It then goes ion to check that he software is all in one piece, then it loads it, checks that it is definitely not already installed and that there is enough disk space for it. From here it now installs the software onto the computer. The rest of the lines basically mean that it is setting it all up and regenerating the start-up files to actually run the new software when the computer starts and ensuring that it is all in place. At the end when the installation and upgrade is successful it then says that the creation of they image was a success and puts me back to the terminal.  

At this point however, the system is not upgraded as I actually need to restart the system to have the new version of Linux running and that is what I do...

After a reboot with no differences from normal i start up the terminal and type the same ***uname -r*** command to see what version of Linux I am now running and here is the result. 

![After version](u29img/afterversionFIX.png)

As you can see the computer is now running Linux version 4.8.12-**2** ARCH and so the operating system has been updated. All in all this process took no longer than 30 seconds as the longest thing that took place was the rebooting of the computer, but that was really quick at a few seconds like it normally is.
