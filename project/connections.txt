Idea 1:

map of the train lines with colours with reading station at the centre and indicators of where all the trains are between the stations

pro: 
colourful
has reading as the centre 
shows connections of the trains and stations

cons:
non-interactive

Idea 2:

illusion mirror that shows a 3D border of lights

 
pros:
unique
stands out
cheap
can contain something

cons:
non-interactive

idea 3:

pictures of old reading to new reading along the walls around the place

idea 4:

Walking that has LED lights that lead up to the train station  entrance that change colour when people walk past. 









This is the concept that will be covering connections at the train stations. From this diagram you can see that it is an LED live map of all the trans that are moving around the tracks near reading and its connecting stations. This display will pull information about the train time table and will light up an LED on these LED strips to show the trains location from the stations. This will therefor use LED strips or tubes for the train display with the different colours representing the different lines. Penultimately this will be quite a large installation that will take up an entire wall in the train station area that is high with population flow so many people can see it. Finally this is just a quickly drawn example of the diagram but I will theme it after the actual map that looks like this *click* and try to re-create it.
