## Introduction

In this assignment I will go through the animation process and show you the many ways that animation can be done as well as how different factors will come into account when you do this, finally i will also create 2 different animations to demonstrate this.

## P4 Describe the software tools available for animation 

In this section I will go through and explain different features that are used when you are creating animation in software and there terms are: 

* frame
* layer
* buttons
* libraries

### frame

When ever you see a video either as past of an animation or really any video at all you think that you are seeing fluid motion and things moving on the screen but in reality you are actually seeing a series of images over and over again really fast and your brain thinks that you are actually seeing fluid motion even though you are not. These images in their own are called frames and the speed at which they are played back at is called the frame rate of the video that you are watching. When you are watching these individual frames the rate at which they are shown to you would effect how well and fluid the motion appears to be. For example if you are looking at a video with a frame rate of 5 then you will only get 5 images shown to you per second and this will look very choppy and stutter a lot and won't provide you with the motion that you wanted to see. But at a higher frame rate like 60 you will be able to see the motion very clearly and it will fool your brain into thinking that there is actual motion where there is not. Due to this when you create an animation you will want to make the frame rate as high as you can while still keeping it creatable in a reasonable amount of time.  

### layer

When you create digital images layers are used to separate different sections of an image so that different effects and processing can be applied to different layers to that only the things you want will be effected. The best way to think about this is that imagine that when you want to create in image you would have different parts of the image in different layers of glass and then to see the whole image you would look down through all the layers of the glass. For example of the glass at the bottom you could have the main background for the whole scene like a hilly back drop or something and then on one of the foremost glass panes you would have the subject of the animation like a character or something. With this set-up when you want to change the subject of the animation against the background then you don't have to redraw the whole image as you just need to move the glass pane with the subject on it over the glass. And this is exactly what the purpose of layers are, they allow you to edit only parts of an image while keeping some of is the same. 

### Buttons

When you are using an animation software you will will probably see many buttons that will do many things but there are a few main buttons that you will see and use a lot more than the rest and these are the play/pause, stop, forward and backward buttons. When you are playing back your animation you will be able to hit the play pause button to toggle the state of the playback of the animation and so you can easily stop halfway through change something and then play again from where you paused from. This is good as you don't loose your position when you are animating. The next button that you will use is the stop button, all that this does is it stop the playback of the animation and then return you to the start of it. This is good as you can instantly play the whole animation from the beginning really easily and get at idea of how the animation will go on. The final two buttons are used to go forwards and back in your animation and so are useful for when you want to move where you are in your animation. There are good as you can easily move by a certain amount through the animation. 

### libraries

Similar to when you are programming, libraries are used to add additional functionalities to what you are doing. For example lets say that want to add in reflections to your animation but this is not supported by default then you would have to apply the reflection on to every frame in your animation manually and that would take a lot of time for something that could be animated. This is where the libraries come into play as there is probably some code that is out there that will add in this functionality to the program that you are using for animation and so you can just impost that library and have all the surfaces that you want reflective.  

## P5 Describe factors that need to be taken into account when creating animations for the web 

In this section I will go through and explain factors that you will need to keep in mind when you are creating an animation for use online, I will be going through the following:

* size
* email attachment
* house style
* output device

### size

When you are designing an animation for use on a website, one of the main things that you will have to keep in mind is the file size of the animation. This is because if the animation is too big then the webpage will take a while to load and therefore will be a bad experience for the user, but if the animation is too small then it will not look good by being compressed too much or you wont be able to get all the animation in that you want. Due to this you will have to keep an eye on the file size of the animation that you create. One of the main things that you can use to reduce the file size when you have created an animation is to use a different format, delay one that is lossless as that will ensure that the space on the disk and the download size will be as small as possible. 

### email attachment / e-card

When you create an animation for an email attachment one of the main things that you will need to keep in mind is that the email will be able to be viewed on a variety of devices and due to this you will need to ensure that the animation that you create is as compatible as possible with as many devices as you can make it. This is because the email can be seen from a desktop computer down to a tablet or a phone and as such you will need to ensure that it can be seen on all of these devices. In order to do this you will need to have the animation is in a format that is widely used and available on almost all devices, the best way to do this would be to have it in a video format like mp4. This will also have the advantage of having lossless compression that will save on the size of the file and so the email will load quickly. 

### house style 

When I say house style, in this case I am referring to the general style that the website has that you would have the animation in. When you create an animation from a website you will need to ensure that the animation that you make will actually be suitable for and match the design of the website. This is done so that it will fit in with the design of the website and actually be pleasant to look at and go to the website for. If this was not the case then people may not want to visit that website as it would look out of place. For example if you have a simple white website design with refined text, then an animation that has bright flashing colours with a dark background would not fit in with the design of the website well at all and it may make people not visit the site again. 

### output device

When you are creating an animation you would need to ensure that the animation is actually able to be seen by the people who need to see it, this then means that you will need to have the animation an appropriate size and resolution so that it can be seen on all screens. For example if you had a really big animation that took up a multiple computer screens then it would not be able to be seen well on a computer with one screen let alone a phone with a screen the fraction of the size. On the other hand, if you created an animation that was a few pixels then it would appear really small on any screen that would be able to see it, this may not be too bad on a small low resolution screen like on a phone, but on a computer with a higher resolution and larger size then this will become much more difficult to see.
