Unit 40 Assignment 1

Introduction
in this assignment I will be going through the initial stages of games development and design. These stages mainly cover the stage of analysis and idea generation from other games as well as research into different game concepts that take effect in all games.

Task 1 - Describe visual style and elements of gameplay used in game design with some appropriate use of subject terminology
P1 - Deconstruct 3 games, explain visual style, gameplay and use screengrabs
M1 - Explain game elements by using illustrative examples and all key terms in the 2 tables above.
D1 - Critically evaluate elements using examples and correct subject terminology. Write on the strengths and weaknesses of the games. 

In this section I will be going through 3 different games and analysing different aspects of these games in order to gather information about how I could create my own game and the fundamental aspects that I would need to include in order to make it a successful game. For this section I will e going though a whole range of different aspects from gameplay to goals and scoring and the environment. I will also be analysing 3 games and these are Ikaruga, Mini Metro and Fallout 4 as these three games are all from different genres and they all have completely different styles and game mechanics. The sections will hen be split into two section one of gameplay and one on visual style.

Ikaruga 

Interaction model

Within all games there is a requirement for a certain level of user interaction in order for the game to be a game and not a film. In Ikaruga, the method interaction for the game is the players ability to control a ship throughout the game and this ship is called the Ikaruga and this is where the name for the game comes from. However, there is also an option in the menu of the game to control another ship called the ginkei however this is seen as the second player ship and as such it is not the default ship and has not as much use. 

Although you get the ability to control the ship through out the game there are still a only a few different ways in which you can interact with the ship in order to actually control it. The interactions that you are limited to are the ability to: move up, down, left and right as well as the ability to shoot, release power and change polarity (the last few points will be explained in a later section)

One final and interesting thing to note is that although the game uses 3D models and environments the player can only control the Ikaruga/ginkei in only 2 dimensions and the 3rd dimension is only used for moving during cutscenes.  

Single player / multiplayer

Ikaruga is primarily a multiplayer co-operative game in its first iteration, however as it developed it merged into a more single player experience due to how computers existed from the 90's to now. 

When Ikaruga was initially created it was designed as an arcade cabinet for arcades in Japan and at that time co-operative arcade shooters were the norm and as such Ikaruga was designed around that to fit into peoples expectations. This arcade box was designed for two players by having two sets of controls, one for each player and each player would be able to control their respective ship of either the Ikaruga or the ginkei and both players would be playing on the same play field and would both be in the same game. After the game was created for the Japanese arcades the game was then released for the Dreamcast home console and this is where the majority of its popularity came from and where most people will remember it form. This was an almost exact port of the original game however due to the fact that it was on home consoles the game was therefore player in a more single player format. The singleplayer experience is not that much different from the multiplayer one apart from the fact that you will only have one ship to fight the enemies but there is no adjustment to the difficulty level. From this lack of adjustment in difficulty the game became renowned for its difficulty among its fans. 

Game setting

Throughout the game there are quite a few different settings that the player will go though in order to progress through the game. Due to the fact that the game is very linear in its style as you can only go through the path that the game defines and you cannot change that fact. This therefore means that the is  slightly different for each level but it will always be the same kind of different and so playing through the game again will lead to the exact same setting. In general the setting of this game is a futuristic world with grand buildings and a high level of technology, however throughout the landscape and scenery of this game there are also signs of nature with forests and lakes seen occasionally throughout. This game is set in a future japan and these buildings that can be seen are part of the dictator ship that has fallen upon the land and that is why they are grand in size and are very mech like in terms of appearance.  

Goals
(D1)
For the game to be playable and have progression there is a requirement for there to be a goal or objective that the player works towards and can have the ability to complete in order to progress through the game. For this section I will be explaining this in two sections, the goal in terms of the story line and the goal in terms of the gameplay and what the player has to do. The story goal is that the main antagonist of the game discovered an ancient artefact of infinite power and has used this godly power to enslave and rule over the land. The main protagonist of the game was working as a fighter against the antagonist but was shot down due to their power and he crashed in a village. From here the people of the village (one of whom was a genius inventor) created a fighter ship that could match the power of the antagonist and free them from their situation. The game then revolves around the main character going up against and defeating the antagonist and his array of weapons and minions at his disposal, as you progress through the game to nearer to the antagonist the enemies get harder until you defat him and destroy the artefact that gave him the power. 

In terms of the actual gameplay for this user and ignoring the story the goal of the game can be split into a few different goals of varying necessity. The main goal of the game is to get the highest score by the end of the game. Points for the score are earned by killing enemies and defeating bosses, in addition to this points are also earned through defeating 3 enemies of the same colour or polarity in a row over and over again. Furthermore, additional points can be earned by killing enemies of the same colour as you are as they are then 2 times more difficult to kill. With the points bing the main objective and goal there are then a few other small goals that cam be done in order to make that main goal happen faster / more efficiently. For example, to get a high score that layer must keep their ship alive and not be killed as this will result in the player losing points and mission out on opportunities for more points as they can't kill enemies whilst they are dead.  With the not being killed part there is therefore the fact that you should complete every level and not dying is the main part of that. Finally, there is also the fact that in order to get the most points you will need to defeat all the enemies that you came across and due to the fact that this game is a bullet hell shooter and that there are many enemies on screen at the same time with bullets everywhere that can turn out to be quite difficult.  

Challenges
(D1)
Games will need to have challenge in them if they are to have some repeatability and thinking involved in the game or otherwise the player would get board from the game and will not continue playing. In Ikaruga the challenge level of the game is very, very high and it is also not varied as the challenge is the same throughout the whole of the game. As mentioned previously the challenge from this game comes from that fact that it is designed for two players but normally only played by one. However, that is not the main reason for the challenge. The main challenge for this game comes from the type of game this it is and how it fits into Japanese culture. The game is what is best described as a bullet hell shooter, this is a game where there are hundreds of bullets or projectiles on the screen that the player must avoid in order to not die as if the player touches one then they will die. In Japanese culture there is a desire for games to be designed around the idea of perfection as that is an integral part of the culture and expectations of people, due to this a lot of the game in japan are renowned for their difficulty and their ability to be perfected is rewarded highly, this therefore creates the challenges and difficulty seen in the game. 
The actual difficulty comes in the form of dodging bullets shot by enemies and the over whelming amount that may be on the screen at any time. This, coupled with the fact that the bullets all have patterns that you can learn create the challenge that drives people to play the game more and get better at it. Finally there are also bosses at the end of each level and these bosses present their own challenges as they are exceedingly tough in terms of their health as well as the fact that they all have their own unique patterns and attack strategies for the player to navigate. Beating the bosses is seen as quite a challenge due to these points. 

Rewards

In many games the player can gain rewards if they manage to complete certain objectives or do something that requires skill and practice, this is done so that the player will play the game longer in order to gain this reward and have a goal to reach. In addition to this games will also come with certain achievements that the they will gain once they have completed an objective or a task and these can be shown off as a proof that they have done it.  Within Ikaruga there are no progressive rewards whilst playing through the game however there are an initial set of achievements for particular task completion and in game rewards for difficult or daring moves. There is an initial set of achievements that are available for beating each boss at the end of a level and these will always show up at the right hand side of the screen when you play through with that save file. However, these can only be unlocked once and once that has happened they cannot be unlocked again and no more rewards are given for the defeat of these bosses. Inn addition to these basic achievements there are also more complex and more difficult to get achievement that will focus on a particular play style or a score. For example there are achievements for beating each level with a perfect score of an S rank which is very difficult to get and there is also a set of achievements for the ability to complete levels without firing your weapon and so on.  
In addition to in game achievements there is also rewards that the player can use in game for completing daring or complex manoeuvres. For example in the game if you kill an enemy of your colour then they will explode and shoot a bunch of projectiles of their colour towards you and these can easily hit and kill you if you are the wrong colour. This coupled with the fact that if you kill an enemy of the same colour it takes twice as long might seem like its very easy but, you can absorb colour that are the same as you. This therefore means that when you dare to kill enemies slower you will have them give you projectiles that you can absorb and as you do this you will charge up your power and this will allow the player to release a powerful blast that can deal massive damage to all enemies on screen.  

Player actions

Throughout Ikaruga there are not any options at all for the player to take that will affect the story of the game and the progression the player through the game. This is because the game is designed to be exceedingly linear with the player going through the levels at a set speed and at a set time, this therefore creates no variances and none that an be created by the player. 
This style and lack of player actions is almost fundamental to Japanese arcade games like these due to the fact that these games are designed to be played over and over again in order to gain perfection of the game and having an alterable storyline or major gameplay changes based on the layers decisions would ruin that.        

Rules
(D1)
Although there are no hard set rules for what you can and cant do in the game, the actual rules of how the game works are very important as without them the game would not work. 
A few of the basic rules that govern the game are as follows: 

        1. Hit a projectile of an opposite colour and you die, losing a life
        2. Shooting enemies will kill them, but if you shoot them with the opposite colour they will take twice the damage
        3. Killing enemies will gain score and killing 3 of the same colour in succession will yield more score
        4. You can swap polarities at any time
        5. You can move in 2 dimensions
        6. Once you each and complete the final level you win the game 

For the game to fully work all of these rules must be kept to, and in order for that to be true at all times these rules are programmed into the games code so that the game runs with these conditions always satisfied and the game takes appropriate actions otherwise. In addition to this, each of the rules are needed for a certain purpose otherwise the game will not work.

        1. This rule is needed as otherwise there would be no challenge for the player and the game would be very very simple, this is also adds another layer of difficulty compared to other similar games as the player will have to keep in mind their polarity and the enemies polarity  
        2. This rule creates a risk and reward system for the player that many different player levels can take advantage of up a point where they feel comfortable. At the most basic level this will mean that a player can kill an enemy with the same colour and it will die and that it will release projectiles towards the player that are the same colour as them and as such they can use these to build up their power. At a another level this will also allow players to swap  to the opposite polarity to kill the enemy and if they do so then they will kill the enemy twice as fast which can e very useful on tough enemies. However, for this reward there is also the risk of the fact that when the enemy dies, they will shoot out a collection of projectiles towards the player that is not their colour and they will have to dodge this of swap colour and these can both complicate the matter. 
        3. This rule will create the competitive nature of the game and be the defining factor in the repeatability for the game. Without this rule there would be no way to score or define how well a run went when compared to another one and it will also encourage a certain style of play for the players who wish to gain more points than other player. With this in mind the high-level players will try to always get multiple of three when killing enemies and this can lead to new routes throughout the level as well as these players learning more advanced  movement techniques.  
        4. This rule is important to the flow of the game as well as how nice the game feels to play. This rule dictates that the player can swap polarities at any time and this is needed in order to ensure that the player can avoid the projectiles that they want to avoid and fight bosses at the difficulty that they see fit. The other alternative that this rule could have been that there is a cooldown for the player switching and due to this the player must wait a longer period of time before they can switch again. Of course in the actual game there is some delay between when the player can switch polarities as otherwise holding down the switch button would mean that they switch constantly or that the button is needed to be pressed every time the player want to switch and both of these also have their negative points. 
        5. This rule dictates how the player can move around the game board and what limits they have for it. In this rule the player can only move in 2 dimensions (Up, Down, Left and Right). This is needed to be stated because although the game is rendered in 3 dimensions the player can only move in two and to avoid confusion this is needed to be stated. This is also important for the game as it defines a set of valid inputs for the player to act out.  
        6. This rule is the rule for the win condition of the game and this will be covered in a later topic of the win condition itself. Without this win condition rule the game would not have an end and the player could never win the game. 

Difficulty

As mentioned previously, this game has a high level of difficulty even through there is only one type of difficulty in the game tat being the projectiles and the switch that comes from them. The difficulty in this game comes from the fact that there are many different enemies on the screen and that these enemies require the player to navigate their attacks whilst also managing the swapping if their polarity. 
In the game itself there are 3 main difficulty levels tat you can select  before you start a game (easy, medium and hard), however there is also an additional level of difficulty customisation in the fact that you can specify how many lives and what the upgrade boundaries are for your ship. These two different sets of options can both be used to increase or decrease the level of difficulty to one that the player is comfortable with however, they both  adjust the difficulty in different ways.  
The main setting for the difficulty tat you can access directly before starting a game affects ho the enemies release projectiles on death. This is the chooses setting as this release of projectiles can be the most difficult item of the game to navigate an to counteract and as such that why it affects these. Below is a list of how the primary difficulty settings affect the game:

        Easy: When enemies die they will not release projectiles towards the player (But they will still shoot and behave normally).
        Medium: Only enemies of the same colour of the bullet that killed them will release projectiles towards the player.
        Hard: All enemies will release projectiles towards the player upon their death.

The other settings for the game effect how the player can carry on playing the game and their progression whilst keeping the actually enemy behaviour and movements the same. The two settings that are available to the player here are the number of lives and continues they get as well as the boundaries for the ships upgraded weaponry. The lives and continues option dictates how many times the player can get hit and die but still be able to carry on the game before getting a game over screen, these settings allow for an option from 1 to 9 with the default being 3.
The ship upgrade boundary settings is one that is not normally changed or taken note of. This setting will change the score boundaries for when the ship will upgrade its weapons based on the score. There are a few different settings for this and they consist of the initial upgrade (at a lower value) and then the additional required points after that for the next upgrade.
Anther point about the balance of the game is that although the game can be seen as difficult the game does have a certain balance to it in a way that the game is completable up to a certain level for even new players. This happens due to the fact that higher level players will try to do the more risky moves in order to gain a higher score count at the end of a level and as such they create their own difficulty for the game that they want. This process creates the balance within the game and actually allows the completion of it for all types of players.  

Game mechanics
(M1&D1)
In Ikaruga there are many different game mechanics that the player will have to use effectively in order to gain access to the higher score boundaries. In this section I will go through only the main game mechanics that are available to the player:

        Swapping polarities
        bullet eating
        Scoring
        Win condition for the game

The main game mechanic of the game is the ability to swap the polarity of your ship and this affects your ships properties ad the bullets that your ship fires. 
In the game there are two different types of ships that you will be  up against light and dark. The only difference between these ships is their colour and the colour of the bullets that they fire. Throughout all the levels ta the player will progress through, there will be about a 50:50 split of these ships and the game will spawn in dark and light copies of the ships at the same time to create difficulty for the player. This actually has an effect on the player as the ships colours affects how you can attack them and how they can attack you. The main rules of effect are as follows:

        If you shoot an enemy ship with the same colour of projectile as they are then you deal a base amount of damage
        if you shoot an enemy ship with the opposite colour of projectile than what they are then you deal twice the base damage to them
        depending on the game difficulty then the enemies can release a burst of projectiles towards the player upon their death depending on what colour of projectile you kill them with. This is further explained in the difficulty section above
        if you are hi with the same colour projectile as your ship ten you will absorb the projectile and it will fill up your power bar that can release a powerful blast of energy  when filled 
        if you are shot with the opposite colour of projectile than your colour ten you will lose a life but then a temporary invincibility as you respawn in the game for a few seconds.
        Penultimately, enemies can only shoot projectiles that are the same colour that they are,however bosses can have the ability to shoot both at the same tie but they will be the colour of the most common projectile that they are shooting or they will have distinct and separate sections of different colours at later stages in the game.  
        Finally, the player can switch their polarity at any time and it happens almost instantly but there is a fraction of a second of delay that adds a skill requirement to the game. This also is what allows the player to best attack and defend their self against different enemies b choosing wheat polarity they wish to be in. 
        

This use of the different polarities then goes along with a high risk plan is a high reward plan. (this has been explained more in the risk and rewards section). For example when there are a lot of light enemies you can go for killing them quickly with the opposite colour but you will have to dodge their attacks as you cannot absorb them. This game mechanic is the main mechanic that the whole game is based off of and as such it is its unique feature. 
Another feature of the game is what is called 'bullet eating' this is technique that comes as a result of the previously mentioned polarity mechanic. Bullet eating is the technique that occurs when you change to the same colour as the projectiles that are coming towards you. Due to eh previously pointed out facts of the game you can see that this would result in the bullets that hit you being absorbed into you and that this should build up your power meter. This is another important game mechanic as it is how you avoid being hit by most of the bullets. Within the 'bullet hell shooter' types of games there are two main types, those where there are slow moving bullets and you have to avoid them the best you can and then there are those where there are fast moving bullets and you have to memorise the game and levels in order to know what is coming up so you can avoid what's coming up before it actually appears. As you can see from the previous statement Ikaruga is one of those games where there are fast moving projectiles and where you have to remember the levels in order to play through the level effectively. 
Due to the fact that Ikaruga is a fast moving memory bullet hell game the bullet eating aspect is necessary to actually managing to manoeuvrer and play through the levels effectively. This is also more relevant with some boss attacks as they use techniques where they cover a majority of the screen with projectiles and then the player will have to more around inside these bullets in order to attack the boss as they also move. 
The third game mechanic that I will go through is the scoring system for the game and in this game it is quite unique in one aspect and very predictable in others. To start off with the scoring is very standard in how it works for quite a few reasons. To start off with the scoring is standard for quite a few ways that I will list below:

        You gain points whenever you kill an enemy
        You gain points when you destroy items in the level
        at the end of every level you get a rating for your score in letters and +'s e.g. B+
        You gain additional score for defeating a boss in a quick time in the form of a time bonus. 
        Finally, you gain score for bullets that you absorb.

These scoring systems used above are very common among the Japanese bullet hell shooter games with the last one in the list being slightly more specific but still a standard. The fact the you gain points whenever yo kill an enemy is not too different to most games nowadays and is a popular theme that passed over and as such needs no explanation.
The second point about there being additional points scored for the destruction of in game objects can also be seen as reasonably standard as quite a few games implement this scoring system. 
The third point about the score rating is not too common outside of japan and Japanese games and this is that your score level is given a rating from around G at the worst, through up to A and then in some circumstances it can even go up to SSS being the highest. These letter scores reflect the number score as well as the quality of play the player had. For example you will always get an S rank if yo manage to take no damage and kill every enemy in the stage even if the players score is low. However, if the player experienced a low level of play where they died a lot and didn't kill all of the enemies then they will get a low letter score even if their number score is high. 
This forth point is also a standard system in games but in more generally implemented in high score based games rather than the standard type of games due to the players progression. This system works in the way that if you kill a difficult enemy or more commonly, a boss in a fast time then you will be rewarded  with a score bonus and this incentives fast yet precise play that the game can use to have repeatability. However, this time bonus has no negative effect and as such if a very low level player does not have the opportunity to kill the boss quickly then they will not lose points but will instead not gain additional points that they had the possibility of getting.
The final point is again more specific to this style of gameplay but it is used frequently in the applicable games. This is the scoring system that you gain additional points for absorbing bullets that you have the chance to absorb. This therefore helps players by intensifying them to absorb all of what they can and from this they gain the previously mentioned powerful bast as well as additional score.

The final sub-section for game-mechanics is the win condition of the game and how players can actually beat the game. In order to beat the game the player has to complete all of the stages in the game one by one and then defeat the final few bosses to reach the end. For this I will be explaining the win condition in terms of the story and the actually gameplay for the player.
In terms of the story of the game the win condition is that the person the player players as (Shinra) needs to defeat the dictator of the land who has ruled over de to the fact that they have a powerful object. This then means that thy go up against the whole of the army and eventually work his way through the higher ranking and more difficult enemies until they get to the final boss and kill them. At this point the player then has to destroy the powerful artefact that brought the dictator to power but in doing so they use too much power to destroy it that they end up killing themselves. That is the win condition for the story of the game as then the player has freed the land from the evil dictator.
In terms of what the player has to do in actual gameplay the win condition is making their way through the different stages and working`ng their way through the increasingly difficult selection of enemies. This goes on until the player then goes up against a final boss and the one who actually held the power over the land in the first place. From here there is then a final boss fight that ten takes multiple forms and from here you then kill the powerful object in a final rush before the game ends. Although this may sound simple and the fact that there are only 5 stages in the game the difficulty and all of the enemies stop you from getting here and so you have to make sure that you survive until the end as dying is the inly condition that means you cant complete the game. 

Feedback

In terms of fan feedback for the game, Ikaruga is highly praised for its unique gameplay and challenge. 
Whilst being a very difficult game, Ikaruga has still managed to gain a huge fan following and people are very fond of it with high ratings everywhere for the game. The main features that are pointed out about the game whenever its reviewed are the nostalgia feeling it gives to people as well as the unique gameplay style and simplicity that the game runs off of. The game is known to give people a great feeling of nostalgia due to its release in the Us and UK on the Saga Dreamcast and this is actually where most people have heard about or played the game before as before this it was only available on the arcade cabinets in Japan. Due to the fact that most people who grew up with this game are now in the business s to review games it seems that it was released at a great time for reviewers these days. This is also helped by the fact that there were not many other games like this on the Dreamcast and so it stood out along with its unique visual style for its projectiles. The other main feedback of the game is that people like the unique gameplay style that Ikaruga offers with the polarities that are at play. Although the polarity mechanic may seem to be a bit gimmicky or difficult to manage it is one of the main reasons that the game has the popularity that it does because it is so unique among these types of games. The feedback for this particular game mechanic is that the mechanic is unique and that it adds a whole new levels of depth and difficulty to these types of games and players respect it for that. This may be due to the fact that these games are known for their difficulty and as such players like an increase to the difficulty to these types of games that is not gimmicky or innovative but this really matches what the player want. Finally, the game is also Highly praised for the simplicity that is has,this is said as there are no in game buffs or power ups that the player can get throughout the level to help them and as such the player must push the basic mechanics of the game to the limit in order to complete the game. And this simplicity and pushing of basic mechanics are what really give this game the popularity and feedback that it has. 
One final thing to note about the feedback of this game is that it consistently rates 8 and 9 of of 10 on review websites and it is quite well known among people who grew up with the Dreamcast and those who are into bullet hell shooter games from Japan. 

Game structure

As mentioned before this game consists of 5 stages and at the end of each stage there is a boss to defeat and finally at the end of the game there is a final boss and the destruction of the power artefact. From a structure point this game is very very simple and this can be attributed to the type of game that it is as well as the expectations of these types of games by players. This game is a bullet hell shooter and the way the structure of these games work is that it is very linear and you cannot control the overall movement of your ship through the game but are constrained to the rectangular border that the screen is rendered in.it is this rectangular border that then moves throughout the game world following a loose story line. Due to this the story needs to be somewhat simple at least for the basic goals and this then creates the linear fashion that these games use. This linear fashion then creates the different stages as you go through the story over and over gain. Finally,due to the difficulty of the game the game overall has to be quite short so that it is actually possible to beat it and therefore there are a low number of stages in most of this games. Below there will be a flowchart of the game structure with the stages and main bosses:

';';';';';';';';';';'; insert flowchart here ;';';;';';';';';';';';

Addiction

When a game is created in most cases the game developers will want the game to have a certain level of repeatability and addiction, this is because the developers will want as many people as they can playing the game as this will expose the game to more people and as such it will make them more money as these people buy the game. In order for this to happen, game developers will use many different techniques to make more people play the game. Most of these techniques rely on making the player addicted to the game so that they keep on coming back to it. As well as this some games increase repeatability in their game by awarding prizes to players who play often but that will not be covered in this section. 
Ikaruga is well known for its addiction and repeatability among its fans and that can be attributed in part to the previously mentioned points about the feedback to the game but the main reason why it is so additive and repeatable is down to the type of game that it is. The Japanese bullet hell shooter genre is known for its repeatability and addictiveness and this is for a quite simple reason, that reason is that due to the way the game works you will get up to a certain point and assuming that you did not beat the game or die and think that you could easily get past that part again in the next run. This then makes the game addicting as the player is always thinking about how they can get that little bit further throughout that level and this will make them play the level over and over again. This is the main draw that people have to the game as you can keep getting better and better progressing more and more each time. This is also coupled with the fact that as you progress through the game your ship will gain power will lead to a feeling that the game gets faster and more tense the further through you go. This will therefore lead players to wanting to get back to that part of the level and feel powerful again, and this also draws people to playing again. Finally, people are addicted to the game as they want to gain the highest score that they can do and this is achieved by ensuring that you have optimal movement throughout the game and this level of perfection can only be achieved by practising the game over and over again thus creating an addicting game to people who want to do this. 

Visual style

World
(D1)
This section is really just an extension to the game setting section previously in this assignment but here I will go though the terrain architecture and objects that are found throughout the course of the game in the background and in the from of enemies. 
To start out with, the main visual style that the game has is one of a futuristic Japan with a high concentration of trees to start out with but these gradually fade in to more urban and buildings later on. The tree and nature that is first seen in the game is not very special and is just general greenery but the futuristic urban look is week defined. The way that the urban look is well defined is due to the fact that it is very unique looking and is very reminiscent of Ikaruga and not much else. This is partially due to the colour palette that is used in the game and the 3D aspects that they contain when flying past them. 
The colour palette that is present in Ikaruga is a very muted one with liberal use of grey and brown but with a tech twist to it so that the player knows this is in the future. This same visual style goes through to the enemies and objects, not just the terrain. In the game the objects that you will see are also the enemies on screen so they can be be counted here. As mentioned the enemies contain the same visual style as the terrain but they don't contain the greenery or dirt look. The enemies have the same tech look on them due to the fact that they have lines and dots on them similar to circuit boards which is what they are trying to represent. This also allows for the different colours or polarity that the enemies will have as they black polarity version is the same as the white just the main colours are changed so that they are easily distinguishable.  
In addition to the main design and colour palette use the visual style of the game objects and world are also very distinct due to their use of early 3D techniques. This makes the game stand out, especially back when it was released to the arcades as this type of 3D and complexity had not been seen too much in other games and as such it made Ikaruga a great game. The way the 3D works in game is that the main object that is being shown in the background is in 3D while the main background in just in 2D, this shows a greater concept of motion while the player is moving. In addition to just being in the background the 3D effects also reach to other parts of the stage and this is mainly the enemies that the player is up against. These enemy NPC's are also rendered in 3D with a similar method that the background is due to the time that this game was made. This comes in useful and shows itself off when the enemies are moving across the screen as when they are you can see that they are in 3D and their movement looks a lot smoother as the camera revels different parts of their design. This is notable due to the fact that most games at this time would rely on only 2D sprites in the game and so their view from the camera was locked to 1 or 2 sprites or the computer would try to generate their sprite in 2D from 3D and in these early cases this did not work well.   
Overall, the visual style of the game is greatly liked with only mild disliking here and there. The main draws to the visual style of Ikaruga is the unique colour palette that the game uses as well as the heavy use of early 3D rendering techniques and how both these features go together to make the game what it is and these are generally thought to go together well. In addition to this, the actual design and atmosphere that the world and enemy designs create does its job well and the way the game is in future japan is very well told. However, not all features of the visual style can be positive and in deed there are some negatives that people have the main negative point that people have about the visual style of the game is that the graphics don't look too good especially when compared to games that have been released more recently. This is quite a fair assessment and I can see why people would say this about the game but it can be true of any game once it gets a bit old it it won't always look the best even though in its time Ikaruga used great graphics. Finally,  the second point that people have for negatives about the visual style of the game is that the backgrounds can get distracting when people are trying to concentrate in the gameplay. While I can completely understand this,  as the background does have 3D parts to it that don't actually effect the gameplay itself and the colours that it have do change a lot during the course of a normal run this should not be too much of an issue. I say this as the game designers specifically kept this in mind when they created the game and tried to remove as much distraction as they could whilst still having the game look appealing. The main way this this was achieved was through the use of the muted colour palette that the game is known for. This helps as the main enemies and projectiles that you should be avoiding are coloured very distinct colours of dark purple and light blue while the background is light grey and brown. Finally, this should not be too much of a problem as all games of this type will have a moving background otherwise the game would not look as good and would lose some of it's appeal to the fans.  

Characters 

Within Ikaruga there are a few different characters that make an appearance and are relevant to the story and play through of the game. Although the characters do appear in the game and effect the story they actually never make an appearance on screen as a character but you are instead told about them being there in the text that appears in game and throughout the lore of the game. In the game there are 4 main characters, 2 people that you can play as and 2 other people who help you in the time before the game starts. Their names are:
	
	Shinra (森羅)
	kagari (篝)
	Amanai (天内)
	Kazamori (風守)
	Tenro Horai

The two people that you play as are Shinra and kagari and you can choose between these people when you start the game when you choose between the different ships that you play as. The main ship (The Ikaruga) is piloted by Shinra while the second ship you can choose (The Ginkei) is piloted by Kagari. It is also important to note that the player does not see the person they are playing as when choosing the ship it is just in the lore that you are playing as that character.
Tenro Horai is the main antagonist of the game as he is the evil ruler of the game setting but there is no information on him apart from his name and role as leader of the Hroai
The other two characters that make an appearance in the game are only there in the beginning lore of the game and they are engineers who help you when your ship crashed and they helped design and build your new ship that can change polarities and allow you to fight in the game. For a more detailed understanding of the lore/story and how it incorperates the characters here is an extract from the wikipedia page of the game that goes over this: 

"Several years ago in the small island nation of Horai, the leader of the nation, Tenro Horai, discovered the Ubusunagami Okinokai—the Power of the Gods. This energy emanated from an object she dug up from deep underground and granted her unimaginable powers. Soon after, Tenro and her followers, who called themselves "The Divine Ones", began conquering nations one after another. "The Chosen People" carried out these conquests in "the name of peace". Meanwhile, a freedom federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge Horai. Using fighter planes called Hitekkai, they fought with the hope of freeing the world from the grips of the Horai - but all their efforts were in vain. They were no match for the Horai and were eventually almost completely wiped out. Miraculously, however, one young man survived. His name was Shinra (森羅?).
Shot down near a remote village called Ikaruga, inhabited by elderly people who had been exiled by the Horai's conquests, Shinra was dragged from the wreckage and nursed back to health. Shinra regained his health and pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane that they had built themselves, called the Ikaruga. The Ikaruga was no ordinary plane, designed by former engineering genius Amanai (天内?) with the help of Kazamori (風守?) and the village leaders. Hidden in a secret underground bunker and launched via the transportation device called the "Sword of Acala", it is the first fighter built that integrates both energy polarities, and is capable of successfully switching between the two. In a two-player game, Shinra is joined by Kagari (篝?), a mercenary of Horai defeated by Shinra. After Shinra spared her life, she decided to change sides and join the resistance. Her ship, Ginkei, is modified by the people of Ikaruga to give it identical capabilities to Shinra's ship." - - - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga


NPC's

Unfortunately. In Ikaruga there are no NPC's as such as you cannot directly see or interact with any other players/characters in game. The closest that you could call an item in Ikaruga being an NPC would have to be the enemies but these are not actual NPC's and so this section has no proper content

Feedback Interface

As with any game there is a need for there to be an interface through which the player can get feedback about how they are in the game like statistics, health, ammo ... And so on. While mist games have a Heads Up Display to display this information, that only really works for first person games and so Ikaruga uses the sides of the screen and play area to display the relevant information for the player. This works well and shows all the information that the player would need to know. To start off with I will list the things that Ikaruga tells the player on the screen as feedback whilst in the game and playing it:
	
	Score
		High score
		Chapter score
		Current score
	Chain Meter and status
	Bomb meter 
	Lives 
	Achievements

In Ikaruga the score is the main feature that you will have to keep in mind as it it's heart Ikaruga is a game about getting the highest score that you can, for this reason the score is divided into 3 sections that are all of use to the player, the current score, high score for section and high score for the entire game. 
the first option here (current score) is fairly self explanatory as this will just show the players current score in the run that they are in. This therefore means they then player can therefore where they are up to on their current run taking into account all the combos and additional points that they have. 
The second score option is quite an interesting one for a few reasons, to start off with the high score for the current chapter and not run. A chapter in this game is effectively a stage and this is a single uninterrupted run through of part of the game without a break. The fact that the total high score for this chapter is always displayed goes along the line that this game is about point scoring and getting the highest that you can. This is because at anytime you can see where you are currently compared to the best run that you have had and it constantly keeps a goal in mind for when you are playing. This can lead to optimising routes through the game as much as you can and getting all the addition scores that you can as well as leaving it open for people to compare scores for certain sectors and creating a community for the game. 
The final score that is displayed in the game is the total high score for the entire run, this is useful when you want to see how far through the run you are in terms of your total points, this can then lead to people to know exactly how this run in total is stacking up compared to their best run through the game. 
In addition to the score interface there is also the chain meter and status bar
