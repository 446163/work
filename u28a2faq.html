We do appreciate the importance of memorials for the families of deceased loved ones and understand how a memorial in a cherished place or landscape can provide a comfort. However if we were to give permission to all the requests we receive, the numbers involved would become extremely intrusive in this natural and beautiful landscape. For this reason we refuse all requests for memorials on land owned by the National Park. For memorials on the other 96 per cent of land in the Lake District, we ask people to contact the landowner directly.</p><p>It is worth noting that memorials, such as benches and structures, may also require planning permission. To informally discuss&nbsp;whether you need to apply for planning application you can talk to a duty planner or attend one of our regular planning surgeries - find out <a href="http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/planning/planningcontactus"><strong>times and dates</strong></a>.</p><p>You can <a href="http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/caringfor/donate">donate</a> towards a selected location or project in memory of a loved one, whilst at the same time contributing towards the future of the National Park.</p>
