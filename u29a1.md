## Introduction

In this assignment I will be explaining and going through the different reasons that might prompt a software upgrade, the problems that may arise from this and the advantages that an upgrade in software can have. 

## P1 - Describe the potential prompts that initiate the installation of new up upgraded software.

In this section I will be explaining the different reasons that there could be for a software upgrade to happen. This can cover may different reasons but to keep this section small I will just be covering a few examples. Below you will find a table that will go through all the different reasons that I will be talking about and for these I will also be cover a few example from my college to show a real world reason. For this section there will be 3 main sections of internal, external and other reasons and these will all have examples with them. 

	* Internal prompts
	 	* system users
		* Problems with the existing system
		* Requirements for additional functionality
		* Installation of new hardware or software requireing new or upgraded software
	* External prompts
		* software bugs
		* external users
	* Other
		* Company policy

When I say internal prompts I mean reasons that are designed for the internals of a company and the people that that will affect. If you think of the company as a sealed off unit then its just the people inside this unit that these sections will cover. This means that they cause the prompts for the software to upgraded or installed and they are also only affected by any problems it may cause. For this I will be explain how the prompts for system change can come around and how they can affect the group that I am talking about. 

The first example here is that of the system users. For this section there can be many different reasons as to why they would create a prompt for the system change and these will be explained within the next points about this section.

The first main example of a prompt for change would have to be people experiencing problems with the current system. Again, this can cover many different example like the software not working properly, software ware not working at all or even that they just get a small error message when they log on to the system that they cant get rid of. But the main example that this would be caused by in most cases could be that the users of the system keep experiencing errors with the system that stop them from doing their work. This does not cover the fact that they have no functionality at all or the fact that they might have new hardware that does not work. This problem of software not working correctly can very quickly and very easily means that the users of the system get irritated with it and are unable to carry on with their work and in this case that is not good and could bring a whole office to s grinding stop. For example, at UTC reading there could be a problem with Microsoft Visual studio that means it cannot save work onto the computers. Due to this, this would mean that almost all of the computer science people would not be able to do their work and as such they would not be able to work for a while and this could mean that they miss assignment deadlines and lose out on a lot of work. This could in some cases mean that they will fail their course and that is really not good. This would then create an internal situation where the MS VS software needs to be updated or installed all over again in order to fix this issue and allow the students to carry on with their work. 

Another main example of internal software prompts that would create a prompt for software to be installed or upgraded would be some users on a system to want additional functionality that is not already there. This will obviously need to be fixed as without the software being installed or upgraded there is no way that the person can get to do what they want to do. One example of this at UTC reading would be the fact that the college laptops here do not have an application called "Geogebra" installed on them and this is used for graphing mathematical functions in a very easy to use interface. Without this software the people who do coursework for mathematics that requires them to take images of graphs will not be able to compete their work and as such they will have to go through more complicated methods to get the images of graphs and this will waste time meaning they might not be able to finish the work they have to do. This can obviously just be fixed by a simple installation of the software and once this has been put on everyone's computers they will be able to do their coursework a lot easier and the problem is solved. 

A third and final example of internal problems that could cause a prompt for software upgrade or installation internally would be the fact that new software is needed to be installed for new hardware that might be in place within the system. Without this software in place then the hardware would be extremely slow or as a more likely case it would be completely unusable and it would not have been worth getting it at all. The way that this can be fixed is just by having the software that is required for the hardware installed on the system and this would then means that the hardware can be used and as such the people who need to hardware can get on with their work. One example of this that could happen at UTC would have to be the 3D printers that we have in the engineering department. When they were brand new in place the college did not have the software required to run them and as such they were unusable for quite number of days while the software was being installed. This then means that for those few days where the software was not fully installed n the system that the 3D printer were not able to be used and people could not use them for their work. However, once the software was installed then the 3D printers worked fine and people could use them. 

Next we move on to the external reasons that software would need to be installed or upgraded. In this section there will be a lower number of reason why the software needs to be installed or upgraded due to the fact that there are less external needs for software to be changed. Now what is meant by when I say external prompts for the system, well image the sealed bubble of the previous example e, well external needs are ones that happen from outside that bubble and as such these changes will apply to more than just the people inside the business. 
 
The first and main example for this section would be that the software that is installed in the system is not quite correct and can fail or produce incorrect results in certain situations. This is more commonly known as a software bug and as such it needs to be fixed as soon as possible and this will then fix the problem from affecting a system in a potentially dangerous way in the future. This can lead to many software of problems not just the extreme case of a system going down ,it could lead to information being stolen, requests going missing, data not going through.... and so on. For example, in UTC because we use quite a lot of new technology as as such we have software updates quite often for a lot of the software. This can range over all of the software that we have such as the Microsoft Visual Studio platform and to windows operating system that we all the time eat college and is installed on all of the desktops and laptops. In the example of the windows upgrade this was essential to the college as Microsoft a partner at UTC reading is now more fully supporting windows 10 and not the old windows 8. In addition to this the software also took a good few weeks to install on all of the machines in college as it had to be done manually on all of the machines.

The other external prompt that I will be talking about in this section is for the external users of  system and how they will need to interact with it. This can as well cover a few different areas but the main reason that it might happen would be the fact that some people will want to use the system when they are outside of the system. This can cover a variety of real world uses but in general it will when people will be working from home in stead of being in their place of work to be doing their work. Due to this happening software will need to be installed on the computers that will allow for the user to connect to the system and carry on with their work. With this though, the main risk and thing that needs to be looked out for is security as this could be a way to get into the system and so in addition to the software being installed generally there may also need to be some additional software installed on top of it that cover more security than the normal software would do. 

The final main section for this is the other section and this basically covers all of the other ways that the software  would need to be changes that is not just completely internally and completely externally. 

The only thing that I will be describing within this section is the fact that the company policy would change leading to software needing to be installed or upgraded. This can happen at any point and there a  variety of things that it could cover and many different reasons why this could happen. For example the system could require additional security due to people having their information stolen and this would mean that the company might enforce the installation of better security software of an upgrade that they have not rolled out yet. 

## P2 - Describe the potential risks of installing or upgrading software. 

*For this piece of the assignment the information was gathered during a group discussion with many different notes and ideas and this section covers the main points that were brought up through this group discussion put into the format of a report.*

In this section I will describing the potential risks that users could face when they install or upgrade software on their machines either as a user or as an admin on many machines. For this section I will be describing the problems and as examples I will be explaining the following:

	* potential loss of service
	* Incompatibility issues 

In addition to this will will also be going through the following risk reduction methods: 

	* Backups
	* choosing an appropriate low-risk time for installation 
	* Incremental installation 
	* Roll-backs

### Potential risks

#### Loss of service

To start off with the main problem that you could face when installing or upgrading software would be that due to problems you face you could create a loss of service for the users of the systems meaning that they cannot use it. This can happen for many reasons but generally when you install software there is a risk that the software will not properly work and will crash or just fail because it could not properly install. If this happens then the software would obviously  not work and this could mean that people would not be able to do their work or it could have a snowball effect and break other software that relies on this software will also break and due to this a lot more of the system could go down than just the software that was updated. If all of these programs then go down a whole lot of the system could then go down and no one would be able to use it while the software and the system is being fixed. This must therefore be fixed as soon as possible so that the system can be back online and functional 

#### Compatibility issues 

The next example of something that could happen and go working through a software upgrade is that the software being installed or upgraded is not actually compatible with the current system and by installing the software it would not work. This is not the same as the other point due to the fact that in the other point the update for software contained issues that meant that it shipped out to customers with a flaw in it but in this example the code and program is perfectly fine, its just not supposed to run in this certain hardware or with this certain software. Due to this in a similar manner to before  the software could not run at all and could also break the software that depends on it. This could then also mean that the system would go own and therefore people would not be able to complete their work and this a problem. 

### Risk reduction methods

In this section I will be explaining the ways that you can reduce the effects and the chances that a failure like the ones previously mentioned. These ways will in most cases reduce the effect of the risks with these previously mentioned however, it would not completely remove the problem or solve it so you need to keep that in mind. 

#### Backups

The first and main example about what you should always do to prevent anything bad from happening when you are installing or grading software that could go wrong (or anything major with a system) and that is making backups. Creating a backup is very easy and it can be done a many ways but all you have to do is copy the files that you want to backup and just place them on an external storage area so that they are not only stored on the machine. This will then mean that if the machine holding the original files gets damaged them the files will still be available and do no important data will be lost. For example, if you were upgrading the operating systems of the machines that you use then you will definitely want to ensure that you have the files backed up as otherwise you could lose them and never get them again. This is because when you are upgrading the operating system of a computer you are changing the programming and code that been allows your files to be stored and if it goes wrong in any way (like the ones mentioned above) you will not be able to read the files for the drive where they are stored might have to be wiped. This can also apply generally throughout all types of important data rather than just when you are upgrading software. The main example of this would be the fact that you should always back up important work on at least one other storage location so that if your normal machine becomes unavailable (possibly due to software installations / updates) then you will still have access to your files in this surprise scenario. 

#### Low-risk times

For the second example here I will be writing about choosing the correct time to do software updates / upgrades so that they occur at a time when not many people are using the system and as such if it were to fail or have an immediate side effect then it can be fixed before the majority of people find out and as such it would not affect their workflow. Now the best time to do these software updates / installs will vary a lot depending on what your company does and how they work. But in most cases the best time for the software will be during the night when the majority of people will not be using the system and they will be at home not working. This would then means that almost no one will notice the system even going down if anything bad does happen and in addition to this it will also mean that there will be a whole night through which any problems can be fixed if any arise before people would notice. For example when working with a relatively low importance system like an email server for a small company then the best time to do the upgrades would be during the night as at this point no on will be using the system and there would be no ill effects if it went down for a few minutes when the software is being installed. Additionally if a problem were to arise then it could be foxed throughout the night and no on would notice, but if there was a serious problem that means the system has to be down for a large amount of time then there are still other ways that people can receive the same information as would be in an email. But when you compare this to a system that is required to be up for basically 24 hours a day then there cant rally be a beat time to do the software updates on such a small time scale. For example if this system was now a ticketing system for a large airline company that has user all around the world using the system to book seats then you cant just take it down overnight as for some people it would not be night and would be the middle of the day. For a system like this the way that you would have to look at the best system downtime would most likely have to be on a weekly or even a monthly timescale. For example if there was always far less use of the system on a Monday then you would select the least used time on Monday to do the software update / install so that the least number of people are affected if anything goes wrong. However, in the case of a big system that requires constant use a better approach would be the next section of.....

#### Incremental Installation

Incremental installations. This is where instead of installing the software on all of the system at the same time you install the software on smaller parts of the system one at a time so that they can each be checked for errors while still leaving some of the system working. For example if the system you are looking to install updates on is split up into 4 sub systems each of which could be covered by the other 3 sub systems if one goes down then you would cant to do an incremental installation. With this you would first install or upgrade the software on one part for the system, say sub-system A, after the software has been installed you would then test sub-system A to ensure that there are not any errors with it and you would then move in to the next sub-system and so on. However if yo do find an error then you will have to try to fix that part of the system and this could mean that sub-system A would go down. But this is OK because we still have the other 3 sub-systems to cover for the downed system so that there is actually no loss of service at all even if as we go through all of the sub-systems needed to be fixed in some way. This is great as it means that you can still have a working system (like a mission critical 24 hour a day plane booking system) fully operation throughout the course of a software upgrade / instalment without there being any loss of service even if the installation fails. 

#### Roll-backs

The final example of risk reduction methods that I will be going through in this section is that of rolling back a system or roll backs. Roll backs are very easy to explain as they are essentially just a backup of the entire system before an installation took place. This will then mean that if the software installation goes completely wrong and ends up destroying the system then you can just roll back the system to what it was before the installation took place. However, one thing to note is that a roll back is not the same as a backup as it only really saves the things that the software update would change and as such if the entire system is completely destroyed and is not able to even boot then a system roll back would not be much help, also if yo need to set up the system from scratch then you cant really use a roll back to just have it how it was before. For example if you were working on a system that required you to upgrade a piece of software that is very critical to the work flow of the system then you would make a backup of the system in terms of a roll back and then you would install the software. If the install then failed and the required software didn't work then you can quickly collect information about why it failed and then quickly roll back the system to how it was before, this would then allow you to have the software at least up and running again very very quickly so that there is minimum system downtime. After this you can then look the information you collected and come up with a solution to install the software on that system so that it will work and you can go back another time to do it and be very quick with your installation and know that it will work like how you want it to. 


## M1 - Explain the advantages and potential disadvantages of installation or upgrade of software.

\**For this section please see the PowerPoint presentation attached to the back of this document.* 


## M2 - Explain the requirements in preparing for a software installation or upgrade. 

For this section I will be going through the different requirements for the installation of software and all of the items that are required to happen before hand and I will also be explain how these will differ for a software update and for a full software installation. Also to note, all of these points are to do with planning the software installation and not the actual software installation itself:

	* sequence of activities; 
	* materials; 
	* timing; 
	* communications with user, management and software vendors;
	* back out procedures;
	* gaining permissions and access;
	* other contractual requirements; 
	* resource allocation
