## Introduction

In this assignment I will be explaining and going through the different reasons that might prompt a software upgrade, the problems that may arise from this and the advantages that an upgrade in software can have. 

## P1 - Describe the potential prompts that initiate the installation of new up upgraded software.

In this section I will be explaining the different reasons that there could be for a software upgrade to happen. This can cover may different reasons but to keep this section small I will just be covering a few examples. Below you will find a table that will go through all the different reasons that I will be talking about and for these I will also be cover a few example from my college to show a real world reason. For this section there will be 3 main sections of internal, external and other reasons and these will all have examples with them. 

	* Internal prompts
	 	* system users
		* Problems with the existing system
		* Requirements for additional functionality
		* Installation of new hardware or software requireing new or upgraded software
	* External prompts
		* software bugs
		* external users
	* Other
		* Company policy

When I say internal prompts I mean reasons that are designed for the internals of a company and the people that that will affect. If you think of the company as a sealed off unit then its just the people inside this unit that these sections will cover. This means that they cause the prompts for the software to upgraded or installed and they are also only affected by any problems it may cause. For this I will be explain how the prompts for system change can come around and how they can affect the group that I am talking about. 

The first example here is that of the system users. For this section there can be many different reasons as to why they would create a prompt for the system change and these will be explained within the next points about this section.

The first main example of a prompt for change would have to be people experiencing problems with the current system. Again, this can cover many different example like the software not working properly, software ware not working at all or even that they just get a small error message when they log on to the system that they cant get rid of. But the main example that this would be caused by in most cases could be that the users of the system keep experiencing errors with the system that stop them from doing their work. This does not cover the fact that they have no functionality at all or the fact that they might have new hardware that does not work. This problem of software not working correctly can very quickly and very easily means that the users of the system get irritated with it and are unable to carry on with their work and in this case that is not good and could bring a whole office to s grinding stop. For example, at UTC reading there could be a problem with Microsoft Visual studio that means it cannot save work onto the computers. Due to this, this would mean that almost all of the computer science people would not be able to do their work and as such they would not be able to work for a while and this could mean that they miss assignment deadlines and lose out on a lot of work. This could in some cases mean that they will fail their course and that is really not good. This would then create an internal situation where the MS VS software needs to be updated or installed all over again in order to fix this issue and allow the students to carry on with their work. 

Another main example of internal software prompts that would create a prompt for software to be installed or upgraded would be some users on a system to want additional functionality that is not already there. This will obviously need to be fixed as without the software being installed or upgraded there is no way that the person can get to do what they want to do. One example of this at UTC reading would be the fact that the college laptops here do not have an application called "Geogebra" installed on them and this is used for graphing mathematical functions in a very easy to use interface. Without this software the people who do coursework for mathematics that requires them to take images of graphs will not be able to compete their work and as such they will have to go through more complicated methods to get the images of graphs and this will waste time meaning they might not be able to finish the work they have to do. This can obviously just be fixed by a simple installation of the software and once this has been put on everyone's computers they will be able to do their coursework a lot easier and the problem is solved. 

A third and final example of internal problems that could cause a prompt for software upgrade or installation internally would be the fact that new software is needed to be installed for new hardware that might be in place within the system. Without this software in place then the hardware would be extremely slow or as a more likely case it would be completely unusable and it would not have been worth getting it at all. The way that this can be fixed is just by having the software that is required for the hardware installed on the system and this would then means that the hardware can be used and as such the people who need to hardware can get on with their work. One example of this that could happen at UTC would have to be the 3D printers that we have in the engineering department. When they were brand new in place the college did not have the software required to run them and as such they were unusable for quite number of days while the software was being installed. This then means that for those few days where the software was not fully installed n the system that the 3D printer were not able to be used and people could not use them for their work. However, once the software was installed then the 3D printers worked fine and people could use them. 

Next we move on to the external reasons that software would need to be installed or upgraded. In this section there will be a lower number of reason why the software needs to be installed or upgraded due to the fact that there are less external needs for software to be changed. Now what is meant by when I say external prompts for the system, well image the sealed bubble of the previous example e, well external needs are ones that happen from outside that bubble and as such these changes will apply to more than just the people inside the business. 
 
The first and main example for this section would be that the software that is installed in the system is not quite correct and can fail or produce incorrect results in certain situations. This is more commonly known as a software bug and as such it needs to be fixed as soon as possible and this will then fix the problem from affecting a system in a potentially dangerous way in the future. This can lead to many software of problems not just the extreme case of a system going down ,it could lead to information being stolen, requests going missing, data not going through.... and so on. For example, in UTC because we use quite a lot of new technology as as such we have software updates quite often for a lot of the software. This can range over all of the software that we have such as the Microsoft Visual Studio platform and to windows operating system that we all the time eat college and is installed on all of the desktops and laptops. In the example of the windows upgrade this was essential to the college as Microsoft a partner at UTC reading is now more fully supporting windows 10 and not the old windows 8. In addition to this the software also took a good few weeks to install on all of the machines in college as it had to be done manually on all of the machines.

The other external prompt that I will be talking about in this section is for the external users of  system and how they will need to interact with it. This can as well cover a few different areas but the main reason that it might happen would be the fact that some people will want to use the system when they are outside of the system. This can cover a variety of real world uses but in general it will when people will be working from home in stead of being in their place of work to be doing their work. Due to this happening software will need to be installed on the computers that will allow for the user to connect to the system and carry on with their work. With this though, the main risk and thing that needs to be looked out for is security as this could be a way to get into the system and so in addition to the software being installed generally there may also need to be some additional software installed on top of it that cover more security than the normal software would do. 

The final main section for this is the other section and this basically covers all of the other ways that the software  would need to be changes that is not just completely internally and completely externally. 

The only thing that I will be describing within this section is the fact that the company policy would change leading to software needing to be installed or upgraded. This can happen at any point and there a  variety of things that it could cover and many different reasons why this could happen. For example the system could require additional security due to people having their information stolen and this would mean that the company might enforce the installation of better security software of an upgrade that they have not rolled out yet. 

## P2 - Describe the potential risks of installing or upgrading software. 

In this section I will describing the potential risks that users could face when they install or upgrade software on their machines either as a user or as an admin on many machines. For this section I will be describing the problems and as examples I will be explaining the following:

	* potential loss of service
	* Incompatibility issues 

In addition to this will will also be going through the following risk reduction methods: 

	* Backups
	* choosing an appropriate low-risk time for installation 
	* Roll-backs
	* Incremental installation 

To start off with the main problem that you could face when installing or upgrading software would be that due to problems you face you could create a loss of service for the users of the systems meaning that they cannot use it. This can happen for many reasons but generally when you install software there is a risk that the software will not properly work and will crash or just fail because it could not properly install. If this happens then the software would obviously  not work and this could mean that people would not be able to do their work or it could have a snowball effect and break other software that relies on this software will also break and due to this a lot more of the system could go down than just the software that was updated. If all of these programs then go down a whole lot of the system could then go down and no one would be able to use it while the software and the system is being fixed. This must therefore be fixed as soon as possible so that the system can be back online and functional 

The next example of something that could happen and go working through a software upgrade is that the software being installed or upgraded is not actually compatible with the current system and by installing the software it would not work. This is not the same as the other point due to the fact that in the other point the update for software contained issues that meant that it shipped out to customers with a flaw in it but in this example the code and program is perfectly fine, its just not supposed to run in this certain hardware or with this certain software. Due to this in a similar manner to before  the software could not run at all and could also break the software that depends on it. This could then also mean that the system would go own and therefore people would not be able to complete their work and this a problem. 

In this section I will be explaining the ways that you can reduce the effects and the chances that a failure like the ones previously mentioned. These ways will in most cases reduce the effect of the risks with these previously mentioned however, it would not completely remove the problem or solve it so you need to keep that in mind.
