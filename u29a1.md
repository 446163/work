## Introduction

In this assignment I will be explaining and going through the different reasons that might prompt a software upgrade, the problems that may arise from this and the advantages that an upgrade in software can have. 

## P1 - Describe the potential prompts that initiate the installation of new up upgraded software.

In this section I will be explaining the different reasons that there could be for a software upgrade to happen. This can cover may different reasons but to keep this section small I will just be covering a few examples. Below you will find a table that will go through all the different reasons that I will be talking about and for these I will also be cover a few example from my college to show a real world reason:

	* The current system is slow
	* the current system cant do what you want it to
	* new hardware is required 
	* software requires bug fixes
	* new company policies
	... and many more

The first point is one that many people will be familiar with as this is one that almost all systems will face and in most cases it can be fixed by installing or up grading software. With this the main cause could be the fact that the current system is running software that is not quite optimised for what it is running or that the software is just generally unoptimised as it is quite new. Furthermore the slowness of the system could also be caused by the fact that the system has lots of other software installed on it that has no need to be installed or it is not needed. For the first example here of the system running slow due to the fact that the software is unoptimised this is always technically a problem as the software can never be optimal for more than one system due to the fact they they will differ with their configurations and so on. Although it can never be perfectly optimised the effects in most cases can be not very noticeable but in some cases it is, however the slowdown may also not be cause by the software being written badly for that certain machine but due to the fact that it is just generally programmed badly.
