## Introduction

In this assignment I will be explaining and going through the different reasons that might prompt a software upgrade, the problems that may arise from this and the advantages that an upgrade in software can have. 

## P1 - Describe the potential prompts that initiate the installation of new up upgraded software.

In this section I will be explaining the different reasons that there could be for a software upgrade to happen. This can cover may different reasons but to keep this section small I will just be covering a few examples. Below you will find a table that will go through all the different reasons that I will be talking about and for these I will also be cover a few example from my college to show a real world reason. For this section there will be 3 main sections of internal, external and other reasons and these will all have examples with them. 

	* Internal prompts
	 	* system users
		* Problems with the existing system
		* Requirements for additional functionality
		* Installation of new hardware or software requireing new or upgraded software
	* External prompts
		* software bugs
		* external users
	* Other
		* Company policy

When I say internal prompts I mean reasons that are designed for the internals of a company and the people that that will affect. If you think of the company as a sealed off unit then its just the people inside this unit that these sections will cover. This means that they cause the prompts for the software to upgraded or installed and they are also only affected by any problems it may cause. For this I will be explain how the prompts for system change can come around and how they can affect the group that I am talking about. 

The first example here is that of the system users. For this section there can be many different reasons as to why they would create a prompt for the system change and these will be explained within the next points about this section.

The first main example of a prompt for change would have to be people experiencing problems with the current system. Again, this can cover many different example like the software not working properly, software ware not working at all or even that they just get a small error message when they log on to the system that they cant get rid of. But the main example that this would be caused by in most cases could be that the users of the system keep experiencing errors with the system that stop them from doing their work. This does not cover the fact that they have no functionality at all or the fact that they might have new hardware that does not work. This problem of software not working correctly can very quickly and very easily means that the users of the system get irritated with it and are unable to carry on with their work and in this case that is not good and could bring a whole office to s grinding stop. For example, at UTC reading there could be a problem with Microsoft Visual studio that means it cannot save work onto the computers. Due to this, this would mean that almost all of the computer science people would not be able to do their work and as such they would not be able to work for a while and this could mean that they miss assignment deadlines and lose out on a lot of work. This could in some cases mean that they will fail their course and that is really not good. This would then create an internal situation where the MS VS software needs to be updated or installed all over again in order to fix this issue and allow the students to carry on with their work. 

Another main example of internal software prompts that would create a prompt for software to be installed or upgraded would be some users on a system to want additional functionality that is not already there. This will obviously need to be fixed as without the software being installed or upgraded there is no way that the person can get to do what they want to do. One example of this at UTC reading would be the fact that the college laptops here do not have an application called "Geogebra" installed on them and this is used for graphing mathematical functions in a very easy to use interface. Without this software the people who do coursework for mathematics that requires them to take images of graphs will not be able to compete their work and as such they will have to go through more complicated methods to get the images of graphs and this will waste time meaning they might not be able to finish the work they have to do. This can obviously just be fixed by a simple installation of the software and once this has been put on everyone's computers they will be able to do their coursework a lot easier and the problem is solved. 

A third and final example of internal problems that could cause a prompt for software upgrade or installation internally would be the fact that new software is needed to be installed for new hardware that might be in place within the system. Without this software in place then the hardware would be extremely slow or as a more likely case it would be completely unusable and it would not have been worth getting it at all. The way that this can be fixed is just by having the software that is required for the hardware installed on the system and this would then means that the hardware can be used and as such the people who need to hardware can get on with their work. One example of this that could happen at UTC would have to be the 3D printers that we have in the engineering department. When they were brand new in place the college did not have the software required to run them and as such they were unusable for quite number of days while the software was being installed. This then means that for those few days where the software was not fully installed n the system that the 3D printer were not able to be used and people could not use them for their work. However, once the software was installed then the 3D printers worked fine and people could use them. 

Next we move on to the external reasons that software would need to be installed or upgraded. In this section there will be a lower number of reason why the software needs to be installed or upgraded due to the fact that there are less external needs for software to be changed. Now what is meant by when I say external prompts for the system, well image the sealed bubble of the previous example e, well external needs are ones that happen from outside that bubble and as such these changes will apply to more than just the people inside the business. 
 
The first and main example for this section would be that the software that is installed in the system is not quite correct and can fail or produce incorrect results in certain situations. This is more commonly known as a software bug and as such it needs to be fixed as soon as possible and this will then fix the problem from affecting a system in a potentially dangerous way in the future. This can lead to many software of problems not just the extreme case of a system going down ,it could lead to information being stolen, requests going missing, data not going through.... and so on. For example, in UTC because we use quite a lot of new technology as as such we have software updates quite often for a lot of the software. This can range over all of the software that we have such as the Microsoft Visual Studio platform and to windows operating system that we all the time eat college and is installed on all of the desktops and laptops. In the example of the windows upgrade this was essential to the college as Microsoft a partner at UTC reading is now more fully supporting windows 10 and not the old windows 8. In addition to this the software also took a good few weeks to install on all of the machines in college as it had to be done manually on all of the machines.

The other external prompt that I will be talking about in this section is for the external users of  system and how they will need to interact with it. This can as well cover a few different areas but the main reason that it might happen would be the fact that some people will want to use the system when they are outside of the system. This can cover a variety of real world uses but in general it will when people will be working from home in stead of being in their place of work to be doing their work. Due to this happening software will need to be installed on the computers that will allow for the user to connect to the system and carry on with their work. With this though, the main risk and thing that needs to be looked out for is security as this could be a way to get into the system and so in addition to the software being installed generally there may also need to be some additional software installed on top of it that cover more security than the normal software would do. 

The final main section for this is the other section and this basically covers all of the other ways that the software  would need to be changes that is not just completely internally and completely externally. 

The only thing that I will be describing within this section is the fact that the company policy would change leading to software needing to be installed or upgraded. This can happen at any point and there a  variety of things that it could cover and many different reasons why this could happen. For example the system could require additional security due to people having their information stolen and this would mean that the company might enforce the installation of better security software of an upgrade that they have not rolled out yet. 

## P2 - Describe the potential risks of installing or upgrading software. 

*For this piece of the assignment the information was gathered during a group discussion with many different notes and ideas and this section covers the main points that were brought up through this group discussion put into the format of a report.*

In this section I will describing the potential risks that users could face when they install or upgrade software on their machines either as a user or as an admin on many machines. For this section I will be describing the problems and as examples I will be explaining the following:

	* potential loss of service
	* Incompatibility issues 

In addition to this will will also be going through the following risk reduction methods: 

	* Backups
	* choosing an appropriate low-risk time for installation 
	* Incremental installation 
	* Roll-backs

### Potential risks

#### Loss of service

To start off with the main problem that you could face when installing or upgrading software would be that due to problems you face you could create a loss of service for the users of the systems meaning that they cannot use it. This can happen for many reasons but generally when you install software there is a risk that the software will not properly work and will crash or just fail because it could not properly install. If this happens then the software would obviously  not work and this could mean that people would not be able to do their work or it could have a snowball effect and break other software that relies on this software will also break and due to this a lot more of the system could go down than just the software that was updated. If all of these programs then go down a whole lot of the system could then go down and no one would be able to use it while the software and the system is being fixed. This must therefore be fixed as soon as possible so that the system can be back online and functional 

#### Compatibility issues 

The next example of something that could happen and go working through a software upgrade is that the software being installed or upgraded is not actually compatible with the current system and by installing the software it would not work. This is not the same as the other point due to the fact that in the other point the update for software contained issues that meant that it shipped out to customers with a flaw in it but in this example the code and program is perfectly fine, its just not supposed to run in this certain hardware or with this certain software. Due to this in a similar manner to before  the software could not run at all and could also break the software that depends on it. This could then also mean that the system would go own and therefore people would not be able to complete their work and this a problem. 

### Risk reduction methods

In this section I will be explaining the ways that you can reduce the effects and the chances that a failure like the ones previously mentioned. These ways will in most cases reduce the effect of the risks with these previously mentioned however, it would not completely remove the problem or solve it so you need to keep that in mind. 

#### Backups

The first and main example about what you should always do to prevent anything bad from happening when you are installing or grading software that could go wrong (or anything major with a system) and that is making backups. Creating a backup is very easy and it can be done a many ways but all you have to do is copy the files that you want to backup and just place them on an external storage area so that they are not only stored on the machine. This will then mean that if the machine holding the original files gets damaged them the files will still be available and do no important data will be lost. For example, if you were upgrading the operating systems of the machines that you use then you will definitely want to ensure that you have the files backed up as otherwise you could lose them and never get them again. This is because when you are upgrading the operating system of a computer you are changing the programming and code that been allows your files to be stored and if it goes wrong in any way (like the ones mentioned above) you will not be able to read the files for the drive where they are stored might have to be wiped. This can also apply generally throughout all types of important data rather than just when you are upgrading software. The main example of this would be the fact that you should always back up important work on at least one other storage location so that if your normal machine becomes unavailable (possibly due to software installations / updates) then you will still have access to your files in this surprise scenario. 

#### Low-risk times

For the second example here I will be writing about choosing the correct time to do software updates / upgrades so that they occur at a time when not many people are using the system and as such if it were to fail or have an immediate side effect then it can be fixed before the majority of people find out and as such it would not affect their workflow. Now the best time to do these software updates / installs will vary a lot depending on what your company does and how they work. But in most cases the best time for the software will be during the night when the majority of people will not be using the system and they will be at home not working. This would then means that almost no one will notice the system even going down if anything bad does happen and in addition to this it will also mean that there will be a whole night through which any problems can be fixed if any arise before people would notice. For example when working with a relatively low importance system like an email server for a small company then the best time to do the upgrades would be during the night as at this point no on will be using the system and there would be no ill effects if it went down for a few minutes when the software is being installed. Additionally if a problem were to arise then it could be foxed throughout the night and no on would notice, but if there was a serious problem that means the system has to be down for a large amount of time then there are still other ways that people can receive the same information as would be in an email. But when you compare this to a system that is required to be up for basically 24 hours a day then there cant rally be a beat time to do the software updates on such a small time scale. For example if this system was now a ticketing system for a large airline company that has user all around the world using the system to book seats then you cant just take it down overnight as for some people it would not be night and would be the middle of the day. For a system like this the way that you would have to look at the best system downtime would most likely have to be on a weekly or even a monthly timescale. For example if there was always far less use of the system on a Monday then you would select the least used time on Monday to do the software update / install so that the least number of people are affected if anything goes wrong. However, in the case of a big system that requires constant use a better approach would be the next section of.....

#### Incremental Installation

Incremental installations. This is where instead of installing the software on all of the system at the same time you install the software on smaller parts of the system one at a time so that they can each be checked for errors while still leaving some of the system working. For example if the system you are looking to install updates on is split up into 4 sub systems each of which could be covered by the other 3 sub systems if one goes down then you would cant to do an incremental installation. With this you would first install or upgrade the software on one part for the system, say sub-system A, after the software has been installed you would then test sub-system A to ensure that there are not any errors with it and you would then move in to the next sub-system and so on. However if yo do find an error then you will have to try to fix that part of the system and this could mean that sub-system A would go down. But this is OK because we still have the other 3 sub-systems to cover for the downed system so that there is actually no loss of service at all even if as we go through all of the sub-systems needed to be fixed in some way. This is great as it means that you can still have a working system (like a mission critical 24 hour a day plane booking system) fully operation throughout the course of a software upgrade / instalment without there being any loss of service even if the installation fails. 

#### Roll-backs

The final example of risk reduction methods that I will be going through in this section is that of rolling back a system or roll backs. Roll backs are very easy to explain as they are essentially just a backup of the entire system before an installation took place. This will then mean that if the software installation goes completely wrong and ends up destroying the system then you can just roll back the system to what it was before the installation took place. However, one thing to note is that a roll back is not the same as a backup as it only really saves the things that the software update would change and as such if the entire system is completely destroyed and is not able to even boot then a system roll back would not be much help, also if yo need to set up the system from scratch then you cant really use a roll back to just have it how it was before. For example if you were working on a system that required you to upgrade a piece of software that is very critical to the work flow of the system then you would make a backup of the system in terms of a roll back and then you would install the software. If the install then failed and the required software didn't work then you can quickly collect information about why it failed and then quickly roll back the system to how it was before, this would then allow you to have the software at least up and running again very very quickly so that there is minimum system downtime. After this you can then look the information you collected and come up with a solution to install the software on that system so that it will work and you can go back another time to do it and be very quick with your installation and know that it will work like how you want it to. 


## M1 - Explain the advantages and potential disadvantages of installation or upgrade of software.

\**For this section please see the PowerPoint presentation attached to the back of this document.* 


## M2 - Explain the requirements in preparing for a software installation or upgrade. 

For this section I will be going through the different requirements for the installation of software and all of the items that are required to happen before hand and I will also be explain how these will differ for a software update and for a full software installation. Also to note, all of these points are to do with planning the software installation and not the actual software installation itself:

	* sequence of activities
	* timing
	* communications with user, management and software vendors
	* back out procedures
	* gaining permissions and access
	* other contractual requirements 
	* resource allocation 
	* materials

For this section the software that I will be using as an example will be google chrome web browser and the software to be updated will be Microsoft Visual studio. I choose these as many people will often want to use google chrome as a web browser and it is not normally installed on systems, a also chose Microsoft visual studio for upgrades as it is a piece of software that is installed on all the systems at college and has frequent updates.

### Sequence of activities

The sequence of activities is just the order that all of the following points should be in so that the installation of the software go through as smoothly as possible whilst still getting all of the approval that it needs. For both the installation of software and the updating of software the order of these events will be the same. 

### Timing

For this first section I will be explaining the timing that you will need to get in order to install the software. For the installation of google chrome you could say that it not a very important software to install as it is a personal preference and the system would most likely have a web browser already installed that you can use. Due to this fact your software installation will be put below other things in the list to do and as such will not happen immediately of there are other things that are required to do. In order to maximise the chance that you get your software installed as soon as possible and with as less hassle as possible you should try to ask for the installation when you know that there is no other major software process going through at the moment. For example if you knew that all of the machines at your work were having their operating system upgraded then you might want to wait until that is done before you ask so that it actually gets done. For the upgrading of software the software in my case the software that is being installed can be very important and necessary for the user to complete their work as the upgrade might allow for features that they have been waiting to use or it night fix a bug with the software that would mean that it would not work properly if not installed. Due to the nature of this software upgrade the timing for this would not have to matter too much and should get dome rather quickly because it is important for the user to complete their work and so it will be placed above other pieces of software to install due to its importance. This will also mean that the software will be installed sooner. 

### Communications with user, management and software vendors

For this section I will be explaining the communications that the user will need to make in order to get their software installed. With this the two main people that the user might have to contract would be the management of the company and the people who create the software, in addition to this there will also be communication between the software vendor and the management of the company in a few cases. For the installation of software that is google chrome the user will definitely need to contact the management of the company so that they can ensure that the security of the network can be kept and that the user as not downloading anything that could compromise the security of the company. This would just be a required to the company management for the ability to download and install the software or to have and IT guy have an appointment with them to install the software on that machine. As few retype communications to the software vendor this would not be needed in this case as google chrome as very well known and as such there would be no know vulnerabilities that could effect the network as if their was then it would be well known. Now for the upgrading of software the process would be the same as the user would have to make a request to install the software on their machine or have the software installed on their machine. However, in this case the user may have to contact the software vendor in order to get the correct information about the update that they can pass on to the management of the company to make sure that there are no other questions asked about what is being upgraded. However, for this piece of software the company may have to compact Microsoft in order to get the specifics of what is being updated to ensure that nothing with the update breaks a company policy or puts any information at risk. This would then mean that the company has to contact the software vendor and that would add another step to the  process to the chain and this could mean that the user would not get their software at a later date then they could get it at otherwise. 

### Back out procedures

When installing software you will always need to have a back-out procedure in case the software you install goes wrong and ends up making the machine unusable or it does do what was intended. I most cases this can just be making a full backup of the system before the software is installed as this would then mean that you could just apply the backup if something goes wrong and you would be back to where you were before the installation. However in some cases it can mean just making sure that the software can easily be uninstalled of something goes wrong as this would completely remove the software from the machine. In the example of the software installation as the software is very well known and is quite lightweight there would be no need for a full system backup as if it failed then the software can just be uninstalled and the problem can be investigated into. This would therefore be very easy to do as the user only has to ensure that the software can be uninstalled and they will know this. However for the upgraded software due to the fact that visual studio is a very complex software that access very low level parts of the machine that it is running on then it would be quite difficult to fix if something went very wrong and as such a full system backup would probably be the best thing to do in this case. This does mean that it will take longer time for the software to be installed but if it is not done and it breaks during the upgrade process then it would take longer to fix the problem and get the machine back to how it was before. This would therefore be better to do in all situations but for some it would not be needed or it would not be faster / more efficient. 

### Gaining permissions and access

This section is just about the fact that when you install software you will need to get a certain level of access to the machine that you are installing the software on as you will need an administrator account to properly have the software installed. For both of the process of install and upgrading software the user will generally not get the account information for the admin account as this would be a serious security threat and could put the system at risk as the user would have full access to the system when they should not have. In most cases there are two things that could happen and that is that the management would send down an IT person to come and fix the problem by visiting the customer and installing the software on their machine in person and the other method is for the software to be installed on the users machine remotely through the network and this would download and install throughout the day. For both the installation and for the updating of software the process would be exactly the same. For the actual in person visiting and installation of software by the IT person the process would be very short and the software would be in stalled quickly but by doing this an IT person is being taken away from a potentially more important job that they would rather be working on and as such it costs more resources but the process is completed quicker. On the other hand if the software was to be installed over the network then the actual process world in most cases take quite a bit longer as it has to find the correct thing to download from the secure server and the correct file has to be found and placed on the server and then it will need to install onto the users machine in the background without them noticing as it could interfere with their other work and as such it will take a longer time to complete. But it will also be mostly automatic and no one needs to manually install the software. 

### Other contractual requirements

For this section I will be explaining the other contractual agreements that the user would have made of the system that will affect how or even if the software that they want is installed. The contractual agreement is an agreement that they user makes when before they use the system that dictate what they are and are not allowed to do in order to make sure that the company stays legal with how they run the system. For this section the effect upon both installing and upgrading software is basically the same as they will both be under the same agreement for what they can and cannot do. For example the user will not be allowed to install software that could put any information on the system at risk as if this were to be leaked it would be really bad for the company and as such they would put that in their contractual agreement that people cannot put any information on the system at risk. Another example would be that the users would also not be allowed to install programs ion the system that they have not been authorised to install as this could put the system at risk in terms of its stability and access with other software programs. This would then mean that any software the user requests to have installed or updated would have to be done so in accordance with the contractual agreement that they signed before they user the system. This will then mean that the software installation would take a bit longer than usual as the user and the management would have to ensure that the contractual agreements are met. 

### Resource allocation 

For this penultimate section I will be going through the resource allocation that will be required for the new software to run on the machines as they may have to be upgraded if the current specification of the machine is not up to the appropriate standard of running the new software. For this example I will be using the noted examples of software to be installed more than the other sections as this one will require for specifics of the software to be noted down and how they generally perform on computers.

### Materials

For this final section I will be going through the physical materials that you might need to get of you want to install or upgrade software on a machine. This will briefly explain the some of the materials that you could need for upgrading the hardware itself. For the installation of software such as google chrome there is no need for additional materials as the software is quite lightweight and ill run on most systems. However, as previously mentioned you may need some additional RAM for your machine and in this case you may want to get an anti-static wrist band so that you do not damage the computer. For the upgrading of software there is also not much need for additional materials as if the system can already run the software then an update will not exactly stress the system any more than normal and you can just carry on using it. However if you want to upgrade your processor for the update so that it can run and compile the code faster then you would need to get thermal paste in order to actually use the new processor for your machine.
