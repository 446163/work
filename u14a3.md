## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the implementation, testing and the analysis of the program that I have created in the other parts of this assignment. I will be going through and actually making the program work and explaining it, then going through and testing the program to see that it actually works, next I will then analyse the test results to see that it actually works and finally I will evaluate the program about how well it it works and compared against what I wanted it to do. 

## P4 - implement a working event driven application to meet defied requirements

In this section I will show the application that I have created with the screen shots showing that it works along with a step by step guide about how I created it. 

### implementation screenshots

In this subsection I will show you the code of the program so that you can see how it all works and how it was implemented, here is the code:


```c
import <sdl.h>
import <Window.h>
int main() 			// the begining of the main function 
{
	window.create("player", 100px, 50px, bg:white);   	// this and the next few lines name and 
	window.show.player(playButtonPause.png, 50, 50); 	// create the windows to be used
	window.show.player(backButtonPause.png, 25, 50); 	// as well as add in the buttons
	window.show.Player(forwardButtonPause.png, 75, 50);
	if ( exists(~/.musicPlayer/cache) == 0 ) {  		// this will check if the cache file exists
		window.create("file", 100px, 50px, bg:white, type:file_sys);
		window.show.file("Please enter the directory of the music that you want to play");
		const char dir = window.file.input(); 		// if the file is not there then it will add
		ls -r | grep .mp3, .wav, > ~./music/cache 	// all of the music in the system in to the file
	}
	musicStatus = 'paused';
	while ( program.status == 1 ) {  	// this will keep the program running while it needs to
		inp = wait.button.press(); 		// read the user input from a button
		if ( inp == "play/pause" ) {
			if ( musicStatus == 'playing' ) {  	// if the music is playing then pause it
				window.show.player(playButtonPause.png, 50, 50);
				musicControl(Pause); 	// run a function to pause the music
				musicStatus = 'paused'; // set the correct image and the correct variables
			} else { 		// if the music it not playing then do this
				window.show.player(playButtonPlay.png, 50, 50);
				musicControl(Play); 	// run a function to play the music
				musicStatus = "playing" // set the correct image and variable
		}
		if ( inp == "forward" ) { 	// if the forward button was pressed then do this
			window.show.player(forwardButtonPausePress.png, 50, 50); //set the image 
			musicControl(next); // actually moves the song to the next one
			sleep(0.1); 	// wait to that the press animation will show
			window.show.player(forwardButtonPause.png, 50, 50);
		}
		if ( inp == "back" ) {  	// if the back button is pressed then to this
			window.show.player(backButtonPausePress.png, 50, 50);
			musicControl(back); // play the previous song
			sleep(0.1); 	// wait to that the press animation will show
			window.show.player(backButtonPause.png, 50, 50);
		}
		if ( song.timeRemaining == 0 ) {
			musicControl(Next); 	// if the song has stoppes playing then move to the next one
		}
	}
}

void musicControl ( char const state ) 	// the music constol function 
{
	if ( state == 'Play' ) { 	// if you want the music to play then do this
		song = rand.int(0,lines(~/.music/cache)); 	// set the song to a random file
		mp3.decode(~/.music/cache[song]); 	// decode the music file and play it 
	}
	if ( state == 'pause' ) { 	// if you want to pause the music then do this
		mp3.decode(pause); 	// pause the playback of the music temporarly
	}
	if ( state == 'next' ) { 	// if you want to play the next song then do this
		cat $(~/.music/cache[song]) > ~./music/hist; 	// write the current song to the hist file
		musicControl(next);  	// play the next song
	}
	if ( state == 'back' ) { 	// if you want to go back then run this
		mp3.decode(stop);  // stop the music playback
		mp3.decode(~/.music/cache[song]); //replay the current song from the begining
		time = 1;
		sleep(1)&
		if ( sleep < 0 ) { 	// if you press the button fast then do this 
			mp3.decode(~/.music/hist[0]);  //play the most recent song
			removeline(~/.music/hist,[0]); // remove it from the list
		}
	}
}
```
