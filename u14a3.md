## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the implementation, testing and the analysis of the program that I have created in the other parts of this assignment. I will be going through and actually making the program work and explaining it, then going through and testing the program to see that it actually works, next I will then analyse the test results to see that it actually works and finally I will evaluate the program about how well it it works and compared against what I wanted it to do. 

## P4 - implement a working event driven application to meet defied requirements

In this section I will show the application that I have created with the screen shots showing that it works along with a step by step guide about how I created it. 

### implementation screenshots

In this subsection I will show you the code of the program so that you can see how it all works and how it was implemented, here is the code:


```c
import <sdl.h>
import <Window.h>
int main() 			// the begining of the main function 
{
	window.create("player", 100px, 50px, bg:white);   	// this and the next few lines name and 
	window.show.player(playButtonPause.png, 50, 50); 	// create the windows to be used
	window.show.player(backButtonPause.png, 25, 50); 	// as well as add in the buttons
	window.show.Player(forwardButtonPause.png, 75, 50);
	if ( exists(~/.musicPlayer/cache) == 0 ) {  		// this will check if the cache file exists
		window.create("file", 100px, 50px, bg:white, type:file_sys);
		window.show.file("Please enter the directory of the music that you want to play");
		const char dir = window.file.input(); 		// if the file is not there then it will add
		ls -r | grep .mp3, .wav, > ~./music/cache // all of the music in the system in to the file
	}
	musicStatus = 'paused';
	while ( program.status == 1 ) {  	// this will keep the program running while it needs to
		inp = wait.button.press(); 		// read the user input from a button
		if ( inp == "play/pause" ) {
			if ( musicStatus == 'playing' ) {  	// if the music is playing then pause it
				window.show.player(playButtonPause.png, 50, 50);
				musicControl(Pause); 	// run a function to pause the music
				musicStatus = 'paused'; // set the correct image and the correct variables
			} else { 		// if the music it not playing then do this
				window.show.player(playButtonPlay.png, 50, 50);
				musicControl(Play); 	// run a function to play the music
				musicStatus = "playing" // set the correct image and variable
		}
		if ( inp == "forward" ) { 	// if the forward button was pressed then do this
			window.show.player(forwardButtonPausePress.png, 50, 50); //set the image 
			musicControl(next); // actually moves the song to the next one
			sleep(0.1); 	// wait to that the press animation will show
			window.show.player(forwardButtonPause.png, 50, 50);
		}
		if ( inp == "back" ) {  	// if the back button is pressed then to this
			window.show.player(backButtonPausePress.png, 50, 50);
			musicControl(back); // play the previous song
			sleep(0.1); 	// wait to that the press animation will show
			window.show.player(backButtonPause.png, 50, 50);
		}
		if ( song.timeRemaining == 0 ) {
			musicControl(Next); 	// if the song has stoppes playing then move to the next one
		}
	}
}

void musicControl ( char const state ) 	// the music constol function 
{
	if ( state == 'Play' ) { 	// if you want the music to play then do this
		song = rand.int(0,lines(~/.music/cache)); 	// set the song to a random file
		mp3.decode(~/.music/cache[song]); 	// decode the music file and play it 
	}
	if ( state == 'pause' ) { 	// if you want to pause the music then do this
		mp3.decode(pause); 	// pause the playback of the music temporarly
	}
	if ( state == 'next' ) { 	// if you want to play the next song then do this
		cat $(~/.music/cache[song]) > ~./music/hist; 	// write the current song to the hist file
		musicControl(Play);  	// play the next song
	}
	if ( state == 'back' ) { 	// if you want to go back then run this
		mp3.decode(stop);  // stop the music playback
		mp3.decode(~/.music/cache[song]); //replay the current song from the begining
		time = 1;
		sleep(1)&
		if ( sleep < 0 ) { 	// if you press the button fast then do this 
			mp3.decode(~/.music/hist[0]);  //play the most recent song
			removeline(~/.music/hist,[0]); // remove it from the list
		}
	}
}
```

### Program screenshots

In this section you will see the screenshots of the program and see that it actually ends up working:

![working example](workingExample1.png)

In this screenshot you can see the program up and running on windows 7. Most pictures will be in the next section where I test the program.

### Documentation

In this section I will go through and explain the program in terms of how it works and then how the program was created. 

To start off with this is a small and simple music program that will work with the inbuilt music player to play and control any music that you have on your system that you would like to play and listen to. The program is designed to be minimal and as such the user interface is as little as there needs to be so that it is not complicated to use. The basic way that it works is that the program will allow you to pause and play the music that you have on your system when you push the main pause/play button in the middle. If the music is playing then the button will stop the music from playing and if the music is not playing then the button will play the music again. In addition to this the other two buttons change the song that you are listening to, if you press the forward button then the music player will change the song that is playing and play another random song that you have on your machine. But if you press the back button then you will go back to the beginning of the song that you are listening to and it will play from the start, but if you press the button again within a second then it will play the song that you listened to before that.

## P5 - test an event driven application

In this section I will go through and test the program to make sure that it works as I wanted it to and that there are no flaws with how I have programmed it. The format will be a testing table to start will that contains the tests that the expected out comes and then the picture that relates to that test labelled so that you can see what is happening. 

test | expected outcome | picture
-----|------------------|--------
does it actually display | the music player will be shown on the screen | 1
does the play \ pause button play music | the music will be playing | 2
does the play \ pause button pause music | the music will be paused | 3
does the next button actually play the next song when pressed | the song changes to the next one | 4
Does the previous button actually go back a song when pressed | The song changes back one | 5
