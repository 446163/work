## Introduction

In this assignment I will be going through the implementation, testing and the analysis of the program that I have created in the other parts of this assignment. I will be going through and actually making the program work and explaining it, then going through and testing the program to see that it actually works, next I will then analyse the test results to see that it actually works and finally I will evaluate the program about how well it it works and compared against what I wanted it to do. 

## P4 - implement a working event driven application to meet defied requirements

In this section I will show the application that I have created with the screen shots showing that it works along with a step by step guide about how I created it.
